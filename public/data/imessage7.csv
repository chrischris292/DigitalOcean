+14257368921,"Dec 13, 2012, 9:54 AM",No,Are you taking chem in college LOL
+12064847887,"Dec 13, 2012, 10:17 AM",Yes,Crap sorry haha I didn't see ur last text forever ago
+12064847887,"Dec 13, 2012, 10:17 AM",Yes,Chemistry sucks. Yes I am
+14257368921,"Dec 13, 2012, 10:18 AM",No,You think you can help me with pv=nrt and gas law stuff 
+12064847887,"Dec 13, 2012, 10:18 AM",Yes,I'm pretty bad at it but ill try
+12064847887,"Dec 13, 2012, 10:18 AM",Yes,One sec I'm out of my room eating lunc. Ill be back in like an hour?
+14257368921,"Dec 13, 2012, 10:19 AM",No,I'll just send you the questions. You can either take a picture of your work or text it to me :D
+14257368921,"Dec 13, 2012, 10:22 AM",No,1) what is the final concentration of a beaker containing 652 ml of 3.07 M NaCl mixed with 445 mL of .91 M NaCl solution? \LF2) identify the element in gas form that has mass= .410 g. pressure=.739 torr. Temp = 496 K. In a 500 ml flask 
+12064847887,"Dec 13, 2012, 11:31 AM",Yes,then add them together and divide by total volume of solution
+12064847887,"Dec 13, 2012, 11:31 AM",Yes,aka 652+445
+12064847887,"Dec 13, 2012, 11:31 AM",Yes,second one use pv=nrt
+12064847887,"Dec 13, 2012, 11:31 AM",Yes,find moles. idk if they give u a chemical equation but if it does i know how to do that other wise im a bit confused
+12064847887,"Dec 13, 2012, 11:31 AM",Yes,my guess would be to just divide the mass by the moles.
+12064847887,"Dec 13, 2012, 11:31 AM",Yes,and match to molar mass of elements on periodic table
+14257368921,"Dec 13, 2012, 11:50 AM",No,Okay thanks that helped a lot. How's college?
+12064847887,"Dec 13, 2012, 11:51 AM",Yes,very fun but really hard
