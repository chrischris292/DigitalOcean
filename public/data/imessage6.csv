+12064847887,"Feb 5, 2014, 3:25 PM",Yes,lemme try mine first
+12064847887,"Feb 5, 2014, 3:25 PM",Yes,i think whats happening is
+12064847887,"Feb 5, 2014, 3:25 PM",Yes,u donÕt actually want to lose the test.asm file here i can send that to u u want to keep that
+12064847887,"Feb 5, 2014, 3:25 PM",Yes,but u shouldnÕt have any ! or ?
+12064847887,"Feb 5, 2014, 3:25 PM",Yes,thats why 
+18479151353,"Feb 5, 2014, 3:25 PM",No,Im going to try and re checkout and commit that way
+12064847887,"Feb 5, 2014, 3:25 PM",Yes,ya
+12064847887,"Feb 5, 2014, 3:30 PM",Yes,i did this and it worked
+12064847887,"Feb 5, 2014, 3:30 PM",Yes,
+18479151353,"Feb 5, 2014, 3:43 PM",No,Ok i got it i had to re checkout and submit. I accidentally deleted and emptied trash the .asm with the paragraph so i had to redo it lol
+12064847887,"Feb 5, 2014, 4:38 PM",Yes,Haha dang that kinda sucks but at least u got it in. 
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2014, 2:29 PM",Yes,
+18479151353,"Feb 11, 2014, 2:41 PM",No,cool thats what I got after I said ix = 0. thanks
+18479151353,"Feb 18, 2014, 3:25 PM",No,Hey i just did last semesters exam for 210 and did pretty well so im not goin to the review session
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 3:57 PM",Yes,Haha alright it's cool. U think u can help me out a bit tomorrow? Haha I might have some questions
+18479151353,"Feb 18, 2014, 4:00 PM",No,Ya sure 
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:07 PM",Yes,is the thevenin resistance the resistance of the circuit when the independent sources are 0?
+18479151353,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:07 PM",No,Yes nullify independent sources and find thevenin resistance if possible. If theres a dependent source use test signal
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:09 PM",Yes,if there is both independent and dependent can u still remove the independent source and try to solve for the resistance equivalent? 
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:09 PM",Yes,also if thats the case if there is all independent sources in a thevenin and norton problem its just straight up find the Req?
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:09 PM",Yes,for Rt?
+18479151353,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:11 PM",No,Uhm if there are both types im not sure. But yea in either case you nullify the independent sources 
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:12 PM",Yes,gotcha
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:28 PM",Yes,for a capacitor
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:29 PM",Yes,is Vc(0) the same just before and just after 0?
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:29 PM",Yes,and inductors current/
+18479151353,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:29 PM",No,Yep and i(0) for inductors
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:29 PM",Yes,oak sweet
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:29 PM",Yes,hm so 2012 i did surprisingly well
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:29 PM",Yes,but 2013 i failed....
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:29 PM",Yes,the fall 2013
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:30 PM",Yes,spring 2013 i did well haha but ugh i hate this i donÕt get the diffy q stuff well
+18479151353,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:31 PM",No,I can explain the diff eq stuff i just have trouble with thevenin/norton sometimes
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:32 PM",Yes,oh yah those problems are terrible.ÊÊfor spring 2012 can u explain how they got the i(t) and vc(t) equations? haha
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:33 PM",Yes,wait nvm i got it
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:33 PM",Yes,so is the general form k1e^(-t/T)+k2
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:33 PM",Yes,or the other one with the Vo?
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:33 PM",Yes,IÕm confused aout that
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:33 PM",Yes,pretty sure u explained this to me earlier lol
+18479151353,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:39 PM",No,"The first one you said is the general sol for the differential eq. To find thise constants, you determine i(infinity) or v(infinity) depending on whether or not you are working with a capacitor or inductor. That value is your B in y(t) = B + Ae^(-t/Tau). To determine A, you use i(0+) or v(0+) and set it equal to Your general sol. So like if i have. V(t) = B + Ae^(-t/3) where tau is 3, and i found a B value v(infinity) = 2v, and i found v(0-) = 0v, then that implies v(0+) is also 0 because of continuity of a capacitor. So i use the eq v(0+) = Ae^(-0/3) + B  where v(0+) and B are known. The 0 is plugged in for t, making the eq simply 0 = A + 2 (with my made up values)."
+18479151353,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:44 PM",No,"If theres one of the problems where it flips at zero then back again at 2, you do the same thing but then you get your new initial condition by plugging in the time it flips back. That essentially becomes your new v(0-) even though technically its at v(2-). But when you do v(0+) now (which is like v(2+)) you set it equal to Ae^(-2/tau) + B where the new v(0+) and B are known, you can solve for A"
+18479151353,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:44 PM",No,"Notice for the latter part, its not simply A+B, its Ae^(-2/tau) + B because you plug in 2 (the first time you plug in zero)"
+18479151353,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:44 PM",No,Hopefully that makes sense
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:51 PM",Yes,hm ok 
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:51 PM",Yes,ya that did
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:51 PM",Yes,i keep seeing this equation pop up though
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:51 PM",Yes,
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:51 PM",Yes,
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:52 PM",Yes,is that related? 
+18479151353,"Feb 18, 2014, 7:54 PM",No,"There was a problem like that in the hw. Thats basically those 2 constants, but if they ask for ZS and ZI, you have to separate the Vs and Vo by distributing the e^-t/tau into the ( ) and then factoring to get Vo separate from Vs. The trouble im having is when you dont have vs and vo but you have numbers i have to figure out how to separate it prolly tomorrow"
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 8:16 PM",Yes,i think it has something to do with its definition. like ZS would be whatever doesnÕt depend on the initial condition so whatever doesnÕt have k2 maybe? not sure
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 8:16 PM",Yes,er i mean ZA would be what doesnÕt contain Vo? 
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 8:16 PM",Yes,but yeah idk lol
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 8:16 PM",Yes,*ZS
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 8:16 PM",Yes,*ZS would be what doesnÕt contain Vo i think
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 8:16 PM",Yes,but ask the TAÕs lol
+18479151353,"Feb 18, 2014, 8:16 PM",No,ZS is whatever the source is. ZI is whatever you have left when you set the source (like Vs) to zero
+18479151353,"Feb 18, 2014, 8:18 PM",No,but idk how to separate it if i have like v(t) = 3 + 4Ae^(-t/3)
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 8:18 PM",Yes,oh
+18479151353,"Feb 18, 2014, 8:18 PM",No,er not 4Ae i meant 4e
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 8:18 PM",Yes,ok didnÕt know that haha
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 8:18 PM",Yes,hm ya idk
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 8:18 PM",Yes,eulers
+12064847887,"Feb 18, 2014, 8:18 PM",Yes,is all i can think of
+18479151353,"Feb 18, 2014, 8:18 PM",No,yeah idk either ill have to figure that out lol
+18479151353,"Feb 19, 2014, 8:36 AM",No,Do you wanna study for 210 at like 3 or 4? Or do you have work or what?
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2014, 8:38 AM",Yes,4 ok? I've got the career fair till 3;30
+18479151353,"Feb 19, 2014, 8:38 AM",No,Ya thats cool. Ill prolly work on the spring 2013 exam and figure out the very last part of the spring one
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2014, 8:42 AM",Yes,Ya I only plan on studying for a couple hours so that sounds good. I've done most of the exams already. I get the differentials for the past exams but I don't think I really understand it
+18479151353,"Feb 19, 2014, 9:06 AM",No,I can try and explain it cuz i get it
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2014, 12:34 PM",Yes,Where do u wanna meet up? I'm in my dorm right now. Ugl? 
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2014, 12:34 PM",Yes,I can go to grainger too if it's more convenient for u 
+18479151353,"Feb 19, 2014, 12:43 PM",No,Id prefer grainger its closer to me lol but i can go to ugl if you want
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2014, 12:43 PM",Yes,nah its fine ill come up. what time u free? IÕm free now 
+18479151353,"Feb 19, 2014, 12:54 PM",No,Im just asking my professor a few questions then im going to grainger
+18479151353,"Feb 19, 2014, 1:20 PM",No,Im going to grainger now
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2014, 1:38 PM",Yes,Alright I'm on the bus. 
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2014, 1:52 PM",Yes,Where u at? Fourth floor?

+12064847887,"Feb 20, 2014, 11:52 AM",Yes,im at grainger right now 2nd floor if u wanna come
+18479151353,"Feb 20, 2014, 11:56 AM",No,Ill be right there im just gonna grab lunch quick
+12064847887,"Feb 20, 2014, 11:56 AM",Yes,no prob take ur time

+12064847887,"Feb 20, 2014, 12:06 PM",Yes,Doesn't say I'm gonna move anyways this is supposed to be a quiet room. 
+18479151353,"Feb 20, 2014, 12:07 PM",No,Lol ok
+18479151353,"Feb 20, 2014, 12:33 PM",No,Where in grainger are you?
+12064847887,"Feb 20, 2014, 12:33 PM",Yes,second floor. u here? ill meet u at the same place we were yesterday
+18479151353,"Feb 20, 2014, 12:35 PM",No,Yea im just about there like 3 mins
+12064847887,"Feb 20, 2014, 12:37 PM",Yes,ok ill walk up
+18479151353,"Feb 20, 2014, 12:41 PM",No,Ok im up there now
+18479151353,"Feb 20, 2014, 6:22 PM",No,Lol how the hell do you do the very last problem??
+12064847887,"Feb 20, 2014, 7:00 PM",Yes,No freaking clue. 
+18479151353,"Feb 20, 2014, 7:01 PM",No,Lol
+18479151353,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:04 PM",No,"hey if I have an array in c, how do I write to it at a specific location? like the first location array[0]É how do i write a number to it"
+18479151353,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:04 PM",No,oh and is the first location of an array array[0] or array[1]
+12064847887,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:06 PM",Yes,First is array0
+12064847887,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:06 PM",Yes,Array[0]=1
+12064847887,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:06 PM",Yes,Is an example
+18479151353,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:06 PM",No,so that would store 1 in the first location of the array
+12064847887,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:07 PM",Yes,Ya
+18479151353,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:06 PM",No,ok. im tryin to do the decimal to binary and im getting garbage values when i print.
+12064847887,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:07 PM",Yes,Don't dereference ur number
+12064847887,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:08 PM",Yes,In ur printf. 
+12064847887,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:08 PM",Yes,Essentially don't use the & in front of the integer
+12064847887,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:08 PM",Yes,I bet that's ur problem
+18479151353,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:06 PM",No,"so if I want to print an array outÊÊlike array[3], array[2], array[1], array[0], my printf is printf(Ò%dÓ, array[i]); "
+12064847887,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:08 PM",Yes,U do that for strings and scanf only
+12064847887,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:08 PM",Yes,Oh nvm
+12064847887,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:08 PM",Yes,Uh haha I'm at work right now but 
+12064847887,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:09 PM",Yes,My guess is ur trying to access something out of range
+12064847887,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:09 PM",Yes,Or ur array is not of type int. 
+18479151353,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:09 PM",No,i did int array[k]
+18479151353,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:09 PM",No,k is the like length of the array
+12064847887,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:09 PM",Yes,Cna u send me ur code?
+12064847887,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:09 PM",Yes,Via Facebook?
+12064847887,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:09 PM",Yes,Actually no on email?
+12064847887,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:10 PM",Yes,I can look at it at work. 
+18479151353,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:10 PM",No,yeah cause idk what im doing wrong. i never used arrays
+12064847887,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:10 PM",Yes,Krestofur@gmail.com
+18479151353,"Feb 21, 2014, 3:12 PM",No,ok im sending it now
+18479151353,"Feb 21, 2014, 4:21 PM",No,Lawl sorry i didnt attach the file then i was cleaning the apt. One sec
+18479151353,"Feb 23, 2014, 12:13 PM",No,Dude what did you get on the 210 exam..
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 12:13 PM",Yes,jesus a 70....
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 12:13 PM",Yes,how about u?
+18479151353,"Feb 23, 2014, 12:13 PM",No,I got a fucking 59
+18479151353,"Feb 23, 2014, 12:13 PM",No,I was so confident wtf
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 12:13 PM",Yes,dude this is so gay
+18479151353,"Feb 23, 2014, 12:14 PM",No,Like i was so confident idk what happened
+18479151353,"Feb 23, 2014, 12:18 PM",No,I like dont know what to do because i also failed my 213 exam
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 12:21 PM",Yes,my other friend got a 40 
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 12:21 PM",Yes,i feel like the average is really low lol
+18479151353,"Feb 23, 2014, 12:21 PM",No,Do you think theyll curve it..?
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 12:22 PM",Yes,yah 
+18479151353,"Feb 23, 2014, 12:24 PM",No,Alright i guess thats better but im still pissed off
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 12:24 PM",Yes,"the scores IÕve heard so far are 40, 54, urs, 57 "
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 12:24 PM",Yes,so IÕm pretty sure theres gonna be a big curve lol
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 12:24 PM",Yes,and the guy next to me i remember highest score he could have gotten was a 50 cuz he left 3 pages blank
+18479151353,"Feb 23, 2014, 12:24 PM",No,Wow thats pretty bad
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 12:35 PM",Yes,so someone i know got a 93
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 12:35 PM",Yes,but thats cuz sheÕs girlfriends with an ECE 210 TA
+18479151353,"Feb 23, 2014, 12:45 PM",No,Ugh still im worried
+18479151353,"Feb 23, 2014, 12:54 PM",No,Did you happen to do the prelab for 210 lab this week
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 12:57 PM",Yes,no haha ill prob do it later tonight
+18479151353,"Feb 23, 2014, 12:58 PM",No,Ok cause its confusing with units
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 1:18 PM",Yes,btw we got a 84 with MP2...
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 1:18 PM",Yes,dang wtf
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 1:18 PM",Yes,what could have missed..
+18479151353,"Feb 23, 2014, 1:18 PM",No,Wtf how
+18479151353,"Feb 23, 2014, 1:29 PM",No,Can you let me know what you get for the last question of the prelab
+18479151353,"Feb 23, 2014, 1:30 PM",No,When you get around to it
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 1:30 PM",Yes,yah 
+18479151353,"Feb 23, 2014, 2:18 PM",No,

+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 2:18 PM",Yes,thats an error i bet
+18479151353,"Feb 23, 2014, 2:19 PM",No,Yeah im confused
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 2:20 PM",Yes,could by comments though...
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 2:20 PM",Yes,but idk
+18479151353,"Feb 23, 2014, 2:20 PM",No,that doesnt make sense every line is commented
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 2:20 PM",Yes,the paragraph? idk
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 2:20 PM",Yes,but we each have diff paragraphs
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 2:21 PM",Yes,and we got the same score lol
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 2:21 PM",Yes,IÕm going with error
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 2:21 PM",Yes,i emailed kurt
+18479151353,"Feb 23, 2014, 2:21 PM",No,ok let me know. cause yeah we all got 84
+18479151353,"Feb 23, 2014, 2:21 PM",No,im wondering if the TA entered 84 cause its 84 pts? but we are interpreting it as a % since MP1 is 100/100? idk
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 2:23 PM",Yes,he says we submitted it late? idk i said we didnÕt...
+18479151353,"Feb 23, 2014, 2:23 PM",No,We totally didnt..?
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 2:24 PM",Yes,ya 
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 2:31 PM",Yes,So we actually lost points. Differences are shown below apparently. 
+18479151353,"Feb 23, 2014, 2:34 PM",No,how?
+18479151353,"Feb 23, 2014, 2:34 PM",No,it outputted perfectly
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 2:36 PM",Yes,"No no. It says that you lost 0 points for a late submission aka you turned it in on time.\LF\LFThe rest of results.txt will show you how your results were different from ours. This is where you lost points. You lost those points because when we gave you an empty database, you stored x5000 as the start of a string which didn't exist and you printed out a line of 4 hex for a page that didn't exist."
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 2:37 PM",Yes,That's what he sent
+18479151353,"Feb 23, 2014, 2:36 PM",No,alright makes sense
+18479151353,"Feb 23, 2014, 2:36 PM",No,man im just having a shitty month i guess
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 2:39 PM",Yes,We'll do well on kl
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 10:19 PM",Yes,Place a known charge on a reference cap and measure the voltage. Then transfer the charge to the unknown cap and measure the voltage. The difference is proportional to the difference in capacitance. \LF
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 10:19 PM",Yes,thats the answer to the last question
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 10:19 PM",Yes,i thnk
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 10:19 PM",Yes,can i see ur answers to the other problems to check mine?
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 10:47 PM",Yes,
+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 10:47 PM",Yes,"also haha can u explain to me why when I am LDR R0,R1,#0 R0 is this huge number when i want x0031 to go into R0?"
+18479151353,"Feb 24, 2014, 5:56 AM",No,"Thats cause LDR is going to x0031 in memory and doing a read, its not storing x0031 into R0"
+18479151353,"Feb 24, 2014, 6:11 AM",No,"For 210, my tau was 10ms, my first eq was v(t) = 100 - 100e^-t/10ms, i(t) was 10microfarads*dv/dt = .1e^-t/10ms"
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:00 PM",Yes,hey did u finish both the practice problems? 
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:00 PM",Yes,for KL?
+18479151353,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:02 PM",No,I cant get the first one to work
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:02 PM",Yes,i got mine to work
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:02 PM",Yes,i can send it to u
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:02 PM",Yes,idk how to put it into memory addresses starting at x5000 though
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:07 PM",Yes,i sent my code to u on Facebook
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:07 PM",Yes,right now it just OUTÕs the string
+18479151353,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:08 PM",No,Mine i know is right but it wont halt
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:08 PM",Yes,u check if character is 0?
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:08 PM",Yes,and then halt?
+18479151353,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:08 PM",No,Yea thats what i did so i stepped thru it loads a nul branches to DONE label and executes halt but then i keep stepping and it says illegal operation
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:09 PM",Yes,hm interesting
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:09 PM",Yes,can i see ur code?
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:09 PM",Yes,idk how to store into x5000 
+18479151353,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:11 PM",No,I just have an addr of x5000 in a register and str (char) (location) (0 offset) and it the array addr gets incremented every time a write is performed
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:12 PM",Yes,how do u do the write?
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:12 PM",Yes,lol it might be easier if u send it to me if u still have it
+18479151353,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:14 PM",No,STR R1 R6 #0 \LFR6 = output array addr\LFR1 = valid char to be written
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:14 PM",Yes,gotcha
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:15 PM",Yes,so R1 would be like x0030?
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:15 PM",Yes,for example
+18479151353,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:15 PM",No,Yeah a zero and write it to like x5007
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:17 PM",Yes,"for problem 2. to traverse through the addresses would i use LDR R3, R0, #0. Where R3 is the address where the output is to be stored and R0 is the current page?"
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:17 PM",Yes,"and LDR R3, R0, #1 for the input bit of 1?"
+18479151353,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:21 PM",No,Let me send you my code how i did problem 2. My range checker for problem one is not working..
+18479151353,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:23 PM",No,I emailed my traverse code
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:24 PM",Yes,to krestofur@gmail.com?
+18479151353,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:24 PM",No,Yea
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:24 PM",Yes,donÕt think i got it haha
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:24 PM",Yes,nvm

+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 2:24 PM",Yes,i just donÕt know the data movement commands haha ok this makes a lot more sense to me now
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 3:59 PM",Yes,just double checking STR R1 R6 means R1->R6 right?
+18479151353,"Feb 24, 2014, 4:00 PM",No,No. R1 -> M[R6]
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 4:00 PM",Yes,right i was just generalizing lol 
+18479151353,"Feb 24, 2014, 4:00 PM",No,Oh lol
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 4:00 PM",Yes,i was thinking it was the other way around
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 4:00 PM",Yes,at first
+18479151353,"Feb 24, 2014, 4:00 PM",No,"No its STR source, destination"
+18479151353,"Feb 24, 2014, 4:31 PM",No,Can i see your cheat sheet? I wanna see if i forgot something
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 4:32 PM",Yes,
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 4:32 PM",Yes,
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 4:33 PM",Yes,Do trap x20 take in a character into r0?
+18479151353,"Feb 24, 2014, 4:40 PM",No,What is x20? Getc?
+12064847887,"Feb 24, 2014, 4:40 PM",Yes,Ya. 
+18479151353,"Feb 24, 2014, 4:40 PM",No,Yea r0

+12064847887,"Feb 26, 2014, 1:39 PM",Yes,lol can u help me out IÕm stuck
+18479151353,"Feb 26, 2014, 1:41 PM",No,"I dont know how to find a. So like the first problem, the ode you have to solve is dv/dt + av = f(t) when f(t) is what they give you. So to do that, your v(t) will be of the form vh(t) + vp(t) where h is homogenous sol and p is particular. Theres a chart on page 105 in your book that says what particular will be but it depends on f(t) (given) and the a value. Idk what that a value is"
+18479151353,"Feb 26, 2014, 1:58 PM",No,Do you have any idea on how to get that a?
+12064847887,"Feb 26, 2014, 2:14 PM",Yes,no lol

+18479151353,"Feb 26, 2014, 2:20 PM",No,No i didnt try yet. Im finishing up number 6 then im gonna try 2
+12064847887,"Feb 26, 2014, 2:21 PM",Yes,Whatever we get two drops right?

+12064847887,"Mar 12, 2014, 1:50 PM",Yes,er i mean 6?
+12064847887,"Mar 12, 2014, 1:50 PM",Yes,i get how to find H(w) for 5 but idk what they mean by find the steady state f(t)
+18479151353,"Mar 12, 2014, 1:52 PM",No,I THINK its A|h(w)|cos(wt+phase h(w)) for each complex exponential.
+12064847887,"Mar 12, 2014, 1:52 PM",Yes,problem 5?
+12064847887,"Mar 12, 2014, 1:52 PM",Yes,or is that for problem 6
+18479151353,"Mar 12, 2014, 1:52 PM",No,Thats 6.
+12064847887,"Mar 12, 2014, 1:53 PM",Yes,lol i donÕt get problem 6 at al haha but with problem 5 
+12064847887,"Mar 12, 2014, 1:53 PM",Yes,what do u do when u get H(w)?
+18479151353,"Mar 12, 2014, 1:53 PM",No,So like Ae^jwt --> H(w) --> A|h(w)|cos(wt + phase h(w))
+18479151353,"Mar 12, 2014, 1:54 PM",No,I turned mine in lol what was 5 again?
+12064847887,"Mar 12, 2014, 1:54 PM",Yes,
+12064847887,"Mar 12, 2014, 1:54 PM",Yes,no
+12064847887,"Mar 12, 2014, 1:54 PM",Yes,not that
+12064847887,"Mar 12, 2014, 1:54 PM",Yes,one sec
+12064847887,"Mar 12, 2014, 1:55 PM",Yes,
+18479151353,"Mar 12, 2014, 1:55 PM",No,Ya so for this one its the same as 6 except you have to find H(w)
+18479151353,"Mar 12, 2014, 1:56 PM",No,So like convert everything to phasors and solve for phasor Y. Then H(w) is Y/F where F is the phasor of the input. Then you can find the magnitude and the phase
+12064847887,"Mar 12, 2014, 2:15 PM",Yes,hm but whats the steady state then?
+18479151353,"Mar 12, 2014, 2:23 PM",No,Its always the steady state w h(w)
+18479151353,"Mar 13, 2014, 6:06 PM",No,You dont happen to have your 210 lab data do you?
+12064847887,"Mar 13, 2014, 7:16 PM",Yes,nah haha i turned it in already
+18479151353,"Mar 13, 2014, 7:18 PM",No,Thats ok i finished it anyway
+18479151353,"Mar 16, 2014, 3:42 PM",No,Hey did you do number 4 on 210 yet?
+12064847887,"Mar 16, 2014, 3:52 PM",Yes,Working on 2
+18479151353,"Mar 16, 2014, 3:51 PM",No,Let me know when you get 4
+12064847887,"Mar 16, 2014, 4:30 PM",Yes,"did u get 2.a. not periodic, b. periodic, c. not periodic d. not periodic. e. not periodic?"
+12064847887,"Mar 16, 2014, 4:30 PM",Yes,IÕm not entirely sure how the periodic stuff works
+18479151353,"Mar 16, 2014, 4:32 PM",No,The only one that i got that isnt periodic is a. And c i wasnt sure about
+12064847887,"Mar 16, 2014, 4:35 PM",Yes,how do u tell if something is periodic lol
+12064847887,"Mar 16, 2014, 4:35 PM",Yes,do u just put it into cos +sin form
+12064847887,"Mar 16, 2014, 4:35 PM",Yes,and then look and see if whats inside the parenthesis are rational or not?
+18479151353,"Mar 16, 2014, 4:38 PM",No,You check each of the w values for each term and if all possible ratios are rational it is periodic
+18479151353,"Mar 16, 2014, 5:06 PM",No,Alright so im getting extremely frustrated with this shit. Number 5 ive been trying for like 2 hrs
+18479151353,"Mar 16, 2014, 5:06 PM",No,Integrate cos^3(t)e^jntdt. Wtf
+12064847887,"Mar 16, 2014, 6:25 PM",Yes,yah i gave up....gonna work on it tomorrow
+12064847887,"Mar 16, 2014, 6:26 PM",Yes,idk how to do problem 3 b like do we just do hella integrals?
+18479151353,"Mar 16, 2014, 6:27 PM",No,Ya i gave up too idk lol
+12064847887,"Mar 16, 2014, 6:27 PM",Yes,cuz we have to do + and - of 1 2 and 3
+18479151353,"Mar 16, 2014, 6:27 PM",No,Ohh no just integrate one to get Fn then plug in + and - for n
+12064847887,"Mar 16, 2014, 6:29 PM",Yes,oh i c
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:18 PM",Yes,yo u guys still working on the MP?
+18479151353,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:19 PM",No,Yeah
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:19 PM",Yes,how does gFilter know where the center pixel is?
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:19 PM",Yes,in the calculateGFilter function?
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:19 PM",Yes,say for example my radius is 6 so i have a 13x13 array
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:19 PM",Yes,where is the middle pixel? 
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:19 PM",Yes,in the image?
+18479151353,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:24 PM",No,I think its ceil(numterms/2) where numbterms is how many terms in gfilter
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:25 PM",Yes,so say i get a sigma value 2
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:25 PM",Yes,radius = 6
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:25 PM",Yes,numterms = 37
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:26 PM",Yes,no i mean 13*13 which is 169 for num terms
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:26 PM",Yes,so if i have 169 num terms. divide that by 2 but what x y point does that correspond to?
+18479151353,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:28 PM",No,Should be the center of your filter. Because you should have made the gfilter array starting from -radius to +radius
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:30 PM",Yes,"but what x y point is that? like example if i had a center at (1,1) but i had a radius of 6"
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:30 PM",Yes,there would be wrap around
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:30 PM",Yes,er not wrap around but the outside pixels donÕt count
+18479151353,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:30 PM",No,"Your center wouldnt be (1,1). Itd be a 13x13 gaussian array."
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:30 PM",Yes,oh so the center of the array is determined by the radius?
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:30 PM",Yes,ok that makes more sense
+18479151353,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:32 PM",No,Yeah. A radius of 6 means extend 6 in each direction from a center pixel. That center gets centered on each source pixel
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:32 PM",Yes,for(int y = 0;y<total;y = y+sizeXY)\LF{\LFfor(int x =0;x<sizeXY;x++)\LF{\LF\LF}\LF}
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:32 PM",Yes,does that look right to u then?
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:32 PM",Yes,sizeXY is like the x/y dimension of the array
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:32 PM",Yes,and total = total amount of pixels
+18479151353,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:32 PM",No,Im not sure we are still struggling with applying the filter
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:32 PM",Yes,okk
,"Feb 15, 2014, 4:13 PM",Yes,Hey Brian u wanna get dinner?

+18477145734,"Feb 15, 2014, 1:11 PM",No,It's kinda cool how you can mess around with some of the gadgets they get. Like Peter was developing something for the Leap Motion today
+18477145734,"Feb 15, 2014, 1:11 PM",No,And they also have an Xbox Kinect here to mess around with

+18477145734,"Feb 15, 2014, 1:16 PM",No,Not sure but it'd be cool. Get paid to mess around with a Kinect ..
+18477145734,"Feb 15, 2014, 1:16 PM",No,I don't think other teams have wiki pages though so it might not look good if we write that we messed around with something else for the day

+18477145734,"Feb 15, 2014, 3:10 PM",No,Yeah Peter said he was waiting for his customer/client to respond for changes or improvements so he has a lot of downtime
,"Feb 15, 2014, 10:07 PM",Yes,Oh ok I see. I feel like we have a lot of downtime too though. I kinda wanna work on a new page but they haven't assigned us anything yet I guess. 
,"Feb 15, 2014, 10:07 PM",Yes,I started playing  with node recently and that's pretty cool
+18477145734,"Feb 16, 2014, 10:38 AM",No,There is that new page but it's based on some new frameworks. Maybe we could take a day to mess around with Hot Towel and Durandal?

+18479151353,"Feb 1, 2014, 4:17 PM",No,"Ok so since things didnt work out completely as planned today, i have completed a majority of converting the database into an array (minus debugging). The code is fully written for that part, minus prepping the registers for the subsequent subroutines. Im heading home now. And tomorrow, remember, go seahawks."
+18589975324,"Feb 3, 2014, 7:10 AM",No,When are you guys free to meet today?
+18479151353,"Feb 3, 2014, 7:11 AM",No,Like 3-4ish not sure yet. 
+12064847887,"Feb 3, 2014, 7:27 AM",Yes,Any time after 1 works for me. 
+18589975324,"Feb 3, 2014, 7:28 AM",No,Kk. I guess we'll meet up at either 3 or 4 in dcl
+18479151353,"Feb 3, 2014, 7:28 AM",No,"ill try to be there as close to 3 as I can. my class ends at 2:50, and i have to do something back at my apt quick before I go to dcl"
+18589975324,"Feb 3, 2014, 7:32 AM",No,"Kk, Chris and I will get there at 3"
+18589975324,"Feb 5, 2014, 8:34 AM",No,"Can we meet at 2 today? I have class from 4-5, and mock trial after that, so that's pretty much the only time I'm free"
+18479151353,"Feb 5, 2014, 8:34 AM",No,I have 210 from 2-2:50
+18589975324,"Feb 5, 2014, 8:36 AM",No,"Kk, then meet up at 3?"
+18479151353,"Feb 5, 2014, 8:36 AM",No,Yea. I also have an hour between math and 210 so ill try and debug on my laptop
+18589975324,"Feb 5, 2014, 8:37 AM",No, Kk cool. So 3 at dcl?
+12064847887,"Feb 5, 2014, 8:42 AM",Yes,I am good for three
+18479151353,"Feb 5, 2014, 8:48 AM",No,Yea 3
+18479151353,"Feb 5, 2014, 9:22 AM",No,"Good news. I got it to halt and print correctly, however it doesnt print the correct choice values (theyre all zeros)"
+18589975324,"Feb 5, 2014, 9:23 AM",No,Sweet. Why was is not halting before?
+18479151353,"Feb 5, 2014, 9:24 AM",No,When we JSR print_hex_digit we didnt take into account that it would overwrite our counters and address pointer and such.
+18479151353,"Feb 5, 2014, 9:24 AM",No,"So i just save them and the start and load them at the return, like the PC"
+18479151353,"Feb 5, 2014, 9:25 AM",No,But for some reason the choice value it reads is zero. So something is wrong w the pointer ill look later
+18589975324,"Feb 5, 2014, 9:27 AM",No,I see. Hopefully it should be a quick fix
+18479151353,"Feb 5, 2014, 9:28 AM",No,"Yeah i think the problem is we forgot to do a read where the array pointer is pointing so it never loads a value, or we load the value and it somehow gets cleared before it prints. The page numbers print correctly"
+18589975324,"Feb 5, 2014, 9:29 AM",No,"so we are getting the correct page numbers, but all the choices are zero?"
+18479151353,"Feb 5, 2014, 9:29 AM",No,Yes
+18479151353,"Feb 5, 2014, 9:29 AM",No,Like it gets cleared or never actually loaded them
+18589975324,"Feb 5, 2014, 9:29 AM",No,is it printing two bits and the space?
+18479151353,"Feb 5, 2014, 9:29 AM",No,Or we loaded them in a register that is not the input to print_hex_digit. Yeah its the right structure
+18479151353,"Feb 5, 2014, 12:01 PM",No,I found the problem by stepping thru it with the simulator but didnt find the line of code. Should be a quick fix. See you at 3
+18589975324,"Feb 5, 2014, 12:07 PM",No,Sweet. sounds good
+12064847887,"Feb 5, 2014, 12:20 PM",Yes,I'm at dcl right now. It's pretty crowded here just a heads up. Might get better at 3 though. 
+18479151353,"Feb 5, 2014, 12:22 PM",No,Worst case i have my laptop for now
+18589975324,"Feb 5, 2014, 12:24 PM",No,It usually clears up around 3
+12064847887,"Feb 5, 2014, 12:34 PM",Yes,I left my 210 hw in my dorm....Might be a few min late
+18589975324,"Feb 5, 2014, 1:06 PM",No,Are guys almost here?
+18479151353,"Feb 5, 2014, 1:09 PM",No,Ya walkin in

+18589975324,"Feb 8, 2014, 10:29 AM",No,"I can't, I'm out of town"

+18589975324,"Feb 10, 2014, 9:23 AM",No,So we're meeting up at 3 at dcl?
+18479151353,"Feb 10, 2014, 9:26 AM",No,Yea 3 is good for me
+12064847887,"Feb 10, 2014, 10:04 AM",Yes,Yah 3 is good for me too

+12064847887,"Dec 8, 2013, 7:59 PM",Yes,I'm gonna talk to him tomorrow
+12064847887,"Dec 8, 2013, 7:59 PM",Yes,Jesus Christ
+18473739392,"Dec 8, 2013, 7:58 PM",No,Did you get an email ?
+12064847887,"Dec 8, 2013, 7:59 PM",Yes,Ya. 
+12064847887,"Dec 8, 2013, 8:00 PM",Yes,Ill make sure u don't get anything for this

+18473739392,"Dec 8, 2013, 8:05 PM",No,I'll be talking to him too
+12064847887,"Dec 8, 2013, 8:08 PM",Yes,I'm saying that i had help from a friend filling out the flow chart diagram and when I finished it wasn't working so what I did to understand what I did wrong was write comments over a friends code for each line to take note as to what he did and then after wrote my own totally different one
+18473739392,"Dec 8, 2013, 8:07 PM",No,How similar was it?
+12064847887,"Dec 8, 2013, 8:09 PM",Yes,Registers were all different. Changed all comments rearranged lines. 
+18473739392,"Dec 8, 2013, 8:09 PM",No,Ok
+12064847887,"Dec 8, 2013, 8:09 PM",Yes,I'm gonna make sure u don't get in trouble man seriously. 
+18473739392,"Dec 8, 2013, 8:09 PM",No,Alright
+12064847887,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:13 AM",Yes,I'm very certain we aren't gonna get a F in the course now. That email makes it seem like there were a Lott of students they sent that too
+12064847887,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:14 AM",Yes,But I feel terrible that I gave u a 0 on the assignment
+12064847887,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:14 AM",Yes,Man I'm hella sorry like u have no idea
+18473739392,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:14 AM",No,Is it just a 0
+18473739392,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:14 AM",No,?
+18473739392,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:14 AM",No,In the assignment?
+18473739392,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:15 AM",No,Don't worry about it man shit happens
+18473739392,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:15 AM",No,It's not like I've not copied before
+12064847887,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:15 AM",Yes,I feel like there's no way it's a f though cuz that's a lot of people they would be failing. But um I'm not sure what they would do beyond that. 
+12064847887,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:15 AM",Yes,Other than a 0 on the assignment. It's just a hunch
+18473739392,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:15 AM",No,Ok
+18473739392,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:16 AM",No,You know anyone else that got the email?
+12064847887,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:16 AM",Yes,I didn't really want to ask but I know for a fact there were multiple people that flat out copied so I'm like 100% sure they got it too. 
+12064847887,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:17 AM",Yes,I talked with them about it like a week ago cuz they were scared
+18473739392,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:17 AM",No,Ok
+18473739392,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:17 AM",No,When are you going to see him?

+18473739392,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:17 AM",No,10;30 to 11?
+12064847887,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:18 AM",Yes,Kk ill sign up. Only one of us needs to
+18473739392,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:18 AM",No,Ok
+12064847887,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:19 AM",Yes,Ya so 6 people so far have responded to the poll
+18473739392,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:19 AM",No,Ok
+12064847887,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:19 AM",Yes,So yah. I'm not as worried now. But um we should prob just plan out what we gonna say later quickly 
+18473739392,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:19 AM",No,Okay sure
+12064847887,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:20 AM",Yes,I think if we just say we worked together then on just the flow chart that should be enough. From what I read it seems like he figured most people did that
+18473739392,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:21 AM",No,Alright
+12064847887,"Dec 9, 2013, 5:11 PM",Yes,since i really messed up on the last lab i already finished this lab if u need help on it i can help u out
+18473739392,"Dec 9, 2013, 5:11 PM",No,I got it done no worries
+12064847887,"Dec 9, 2013, 5:12 PM",Yes,aight u mind if i ask u some questions later on ur code in case he asks questions about it?
+12064847887,"Dec 9, 2013, 5:12 PM",Yes,and also yah one of my other friends got it too with like a group of four people he told me there were 20+ people that got the same thing apparently....
+18473739392,"Dec 9, 2013, 5:13 PM",No,Ok cool 
+18473739392,"Dec 9, 2013, 5:14 PM",No,Hopefully he just gives us a 0 on the assignment
+12064847887,"Dec 9, 2013, 5:46 PM",Yes,ya...i hope so too
+12064847887,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:40 PM",Yes,hey so IÕve been going over the code i have a few questions are u available now? its cool if ur not 
+18473739392,"Dec 9, 2013, 7:41 PM",No,Ye come on over
+18473739392,"Dec 9, 2013, 8:43 PM",No,I figured it out

+12064847887,"Dec 10, 2013, 7:38 AM",Yes,"We said we came up with the algorithm together as a group, then sat down next to each other on three seperate comps and wrote out programs and helped each other as we were writing the code"
+12064847887,"Dec 10, 2013, 7:51 AM",Yes,Wanna meet up somewhere before we go?

+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 2:28 PM",No,That's the solution though
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 2:28 PM",No,XOO30 is 0 in ASCII
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 2:28 PM",No,But I'm not sure how that relates to the problem
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 2:29 PM",Yes,Ya I saw that on an example problem. Ugh k. 
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 2:31 PM",Yes,Are we supposed to know the ASCII value of characters?
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 2:31 PM",Yes,Oh wait nvm. We get it
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 2:32 PM",No,Mind explaining?
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 2:32 PM",Yes,We get it on our note sheet they give us for the exam
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 2:32 PM",Yes,It has all the hex character values. 
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 2:33 PM",Yes,Tells me character 0 is hex 30
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 2:34 PM",No,Oh nvm .. Yea we get it
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 2:39 PM",Yes,Why must the count be less than 9?
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 2:38 PM",No,That's related to the 3rd blank ..
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 2:40 PM",Yes,Oh. Ugh. 
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 3:04 PM",Yes,can u send me ur answers to the questions before that problem? i feel like IÕm doing it wrong

+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 3:10 PM",Yes,i struggled pretty hard on that copy problem
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 4:08 PM",Yes,do u know how the control bits work for the first problem?
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 4:19 PM",No,Whenever you read and write control is 001
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 4:22 PM",Yes,hm what is it when its not?
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 4:22 PM",Yes,is that all we have to know for control bits?
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 4:23 PM",No,000 when it's not
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 4:23 PM",No,I think so
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 5:01 PM",Yes,can i see ur answer to number 4. just finished it
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 5:05 PM",No,

+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 5:32 PM",Yes,lol.....our answer to the program was legit identical.....
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 5:32 PM",No,Haha 
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:00 PM",Yes,hm when do u plan on getting back i have a few questions

+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:18 PM",Yes,hm k ill ask u tomorrow i guess then
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:29 PM",Yes,well actually one of my questions pertains to the FSM cuz where did u make a way for the CR input to make it return to the initial state
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:31 PM",Yes,oh nv
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:32 PM",Yes,u didnÕt show it in ur state diagram but i see it in ur truth table
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:32 PM",Yes,for 7. C though how did u get that answer?
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:33 PM",Yes,and if u donÕt mind answering the question over text lol its fine if u donÕt want to type it out i can ask u tomorrow too but for question 6.c. i got something totally different and was wondering how u got urs
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:37 PM",Yes,well actually no not incredibly different. i used ZEXT instead of SEXT how come its SEXT? i misread ADDR as something else haha
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:37 PM",No,Sorry was working on something
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:46 PM",Yes,
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:55 PM",No,That looks right
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:55 PM",No,Isn't it the same thing
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:56 PM",Yes,i wasnÕt sure cuz u didnÕt have the sign extended at the add but ya now that i think about it it is
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:56 PM",Yes,lol well my only issue right now is just number 1
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:56 PM",Yes,i donÕt really get it at all. but ill wait till u get back
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:57 PM",Yes,did u end up doing 2012?
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:57 PM",No,Ok
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:57 PM",No,Nope 
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:57 PM",No,Working on physics 
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:57 PM",No,At the moment
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:57 PM",Yes,ah gotcha. yah i dont think IÕm gonna do 2012 either
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:57 PM",Yes,i can help u out with physics later if u want. i think i got all the material down pretty well now
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:59 PM",No,Yeah I'll let u know
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:59 PM",No,Are you taking the conflict ?
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:59 PM",Yes,ya
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:59 PM",Yes,id be down to study with u tomorrow though after ECE
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:59 PM",No,I'm taking the one at 7
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 6:59 PM",Yes,i have to sign an apartment lease right after but after that around five i should be ok 
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 7:00 PM",Yes,yah well IÕm figuring ur prob gonna study from 5-7 right?
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 7:00 PM",No,Yup
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 7:01 PM",Yes,alright ill prob join u then
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 7:01 PM",Yes,btw so i didnÕt go to lecure all of this week and last
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 7:01 PM",Yes,was it all just microinstructions?
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 7:02 PM",No,He just went through examples
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 7:03 PM",Yes,okk
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 7:11 PM",Yes,so lol i never went to lecture for microinstructions...where is the best place to learn this...
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 7:11 PM",No,Go through the lecture notes I guess
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 7:16 PM",Yes,haha they are so confusing...like it makes no sense. ugh w/e ill figure it out
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 7:16 PM",Yes,so microinstructions really only deal with memory
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 7:18 PM",No,To be honest I don't know what micro instructions are what your referring to lol
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 7:27 PM",Yes,question 1on the exam haha
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 7:52 PM",No,Oh lol 
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 7:52 PM",No,It's basically the lab
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 7:54 PM",Yes,i guess the only thing i donÕt get is where do i choose what a microinstruction is from?
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 7:54 PM",Yes,is it all the states in the FSM?
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 7:54 PM",Yes,oh it is lol i think i get it now but does IRD always stay 0? and how come there are a couple extra 0Õs in front of the CP instruction
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 7:58 PM",No,I will have to take a look at it
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 7:58 PM",No,I'll let u know in the morning
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 8:06 PM",Yes,ok one last question
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 8:06 PM",Yes,where is state 13 in the FSM?
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 8:06 PM",Yes,like i canÕt find it anywhere lol
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 8:06 PM",Yes,its ur call for SR to MAR
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 8:07 PM",No,That's the oppose
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 8:07 PM",No,Opcode
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 8:07 PM",No,It's given
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 8:08 PM",Yes,ya like its not on the note sheet though
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 8:08 PM",Yes,1101?
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 8:08 PM",Yes,oh
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 8:08 PM",Yes,ok
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 8:08 PM",Yes,but where would u get the command SR to MAR from then?
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 8:08 PM",Yes,i thought all the ROM addresses were coming from the FSM also?
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 8:09 PM",Yes,except unused
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 8:09 PM",No,Because you need to take the data from the first register and store it into memory
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 8:09 PM",Yes,so these microinstructions can just be w/e? they donÕt have to follow the FSM?
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 8:10 PM",No,Ye
+18473739392,"Dec 15, 2013, 8:11 PM",No,Buts it better if you do cuz then you don't have to create a new instruction
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 8:11 PM",Yes,gotcha
+12064847887,"Dec 16, 2013, 6:59 AM",Yes,Hey where u at?

+18473739392,"Dec 16, 2013, 3:02 PM",No,Hoping for a huge curve
+12064847887,"Dec 16, 2013, 3:04 PM",Yes,Micro sequencer...wtf...
+18473739392,"Dec 16, 2013, 3:02 PM",No,Left that blank lost 10 points there
+12064847887,"Dec 16, 2013, 3:04 PM",Yes,Just gave a random guess
+12064847887,"Dec 16, 2013, 3:06 PM",Yes,Well I'm not really in the mood for physics anymore. So I'm going back haha sorry man
+18473739392,"Dec 16, 2013, 3:06 PM",No,I can imagine.. I have no idea how in going to take this
+12064847887,"Dec 16, 2013, 3:07 PM",Yes,Good luck man. 
+12064847887,"Dec 16, 2013, 3:07 PM",Yes,I'm sure physics will be better thoughh nothin can be as bad as that.

+12064847887,"Feb 12, 2014, 2:18 PM",Yes,IÕm kinda confused on how to do 3 lol is it just like P=IR^2? with two resistors in series?
+12064847887,"Feb 12, 2014, 2:18 PM",Yes,it seems too easy
+18473739392,"Feb 12, 2014, 2:19 PM",No,Ye it's just that

+18473739392,"Mar 12, 2014, 3:36 PM",No,What two racial projects did you use in your paper
+18473739392,"Mar 12, 2014, 4:13 PM",No,?
+12064847887,"Mar 12, 2014, 4:14 PM",Yes,Ummm it was model minority and I didn't think of another one. 
+18473739392,"Mar 12, 2014, 4:15 PM",No,How did you answer the question .. Relate th racial projects found in your article to two other racial projects that have historically impacted Asian Americans?
+12064847887,"Mar 12, 2014, 6:10 PM",Yes,i didnÕt lol
+12064847887,"Mar 12, 2014, 6:10 PM",Yes,we just gave it to a peer

+12064847887,"Mar 12, 2014, 6:10 PM",Yes,*what
+12064847887,"Mar 17, 2014, 9:05 AM",Yes,How much 210 have u done?
+18473739392,"Mar 17, 2014, 9:04 AM",No,2 problems
+12064847887,"Mar 17, 2014, 9:06 AM",Yes,1 and2. Kk me 2 I started three. 
+12064847887,"Mar 17, 2014, 9:06 AM",Yes,Let's work on it later
+18473739392,"Mar 17, 2014, 9:06 AM",No,Yeah I'm going to office hours at 4
+12064847887,"Mar 17, 2014, 9:07 AM",Yes,Kk
+18473739392,"Mar 17, 2014, 9:06 AM",No,Did u finish the mp?
+12064847887,"Mar 17, 2014, 9:11 AM",Yes,Gona work on it today
+12064847887,"Mar 17, 2014, 9:12 AM",Yes,I outlined it in my head today though. I'm really stressed out about 210 though. I literally know nothing right now. 
+18473739392,"Mar 17, 2014, 9:14 AM",No,Read the text
+18473739392,"Mar 17, 2014, 9:14 AM",No,It helps
+12064847887,"Mar 17, 2014, 9:17 AM",Yes,Yah I tried lol I don't understand it. Ill prob just ask u a ton of questions today then. 
+18473739392,"Mar 17, 2014, 9:18 AM",No,Alright 
+12064847887,"Mar 17, 2014, 4:18 PM",Yes,Did u finish?
+18473739392,"Mar 17, 2014, 4:17 PM",No,Yeah
+12064847887,"Mar 17, 2014, 4:19 PM",Yes,Dam. It was hard rigt?
+18473739392,"Mar 17, 2014, 4:19 PM",No,Yeh kinda .. The professor showed an easy way to do it without integrating
+12064847887,"Mar 17, 2014, 4:19 PM",Yes,Wtf prof came?
+18473739392,"Mar 17, 2014, 4:19 PM",No,He walked us the through the steps so I just copied it down
+18473739392,"Mar 17, 2014, 4:19 PM",No,Yeah Alvarez
+12064847887,"Mar 17, 2014, 4:20 PM",Yes,Oh show me some time if u still remember. 
+18473739392,"Mar 17, 2014, 4:19 PM",No,Lol I'll try
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:15 PM",Yes,have ud one the ECE MP yet?
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:16 PM",No,Finished calculategfilter
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:16 PM",No,Haven't done blur image
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:16 PM",No,I mean I have written code but it doesn't work
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:16 PM",Yes,what is it asking us to do for calculateGFilter?
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:16 PM",Yes,i donÕt even understand
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:17 PM",Yes,the size of gFilter is just an array size of 8
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:17 PM",Yes,is that the neighboring pixels?
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:17 PM",No,Yeah
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:17 PM",No,The g filter is an array 
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:17 PM",No,There is an equation that calculates the value of the filter for each element in the array
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:17 PM",No,And then add the values up and then each pixel value gets divided by the sum
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:19 PM",Yes,how do u know the x y values of each element in the array
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:20 PM",No,That's just your for loop index
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:20 PM",No,X y refers to the row and column
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:20 PM",Yes,doesnÕt the equation rely on the x y values though?
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:20 PM",Yes,so
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:20 PM",Yes,cuz its a single array
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:21 PM",Yes,how does array element at 3 correlate to the x y position
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:22 PM",No,I used a 2 d array
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:22 PM",No,For the filter
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:22 PM",Yes,oh did u change the parameters?
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:22 PM",Yes,cuz i think its just a 1 d array right now
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:23 PM",No,No
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:24 PM",No,I used 2 for loops to go through th row and columns and calculated the value like that
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:24 PM",Yes,oh but the array gFilter is just a one D array right?
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:24 PM",No,Yeah when u get the value 
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:26 PM",No,Gfilter + row times width plus colum 
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:26 PM",No,And store is like that
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:26 PM",Yes,hm IÕm still confused so like what does gFilter hold the value of then? are u working on it now?
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:26 PM",No,Nope 
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:26 PM",No,Try going to office hours
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:28 PM",No,Gfilyer holds the value of that equation 
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:28 PM",No,X and y are the rows and colums for each pixel 
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:28 PM",Yes,i just donÕt get what gFilter[0] gFilter[1] correspond to
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:28 PM",No,Calculate the value and store it in gfilter which is a 1 d array
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:28 PM",No,Gfilter[o] points to the first pixel .. Row o column I
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:28 PM",No,0
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:30 PM",Yes,ok but because Gfilter is only size 8 is it just the 8 neighboring pixels?
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:30 PM",Yes,"so GFilter[4] = (0,1)?"
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:30 PM",Yes,"if the source pixel is at (1,1)?"
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:30 PM",No,The filter is a 3x3 
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:30 PM",No,Gfilter [4] is row 1 column 0
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:30 PM",Yes,oh ok 
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:32 PM",Yes,hm i guess i get it but for the equation how do i get the x y coordinate out of the gFilter array?
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:32 PM",No,Use 2 for loop and get the value of each pixel using  the equation 
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:34 PM",No,And then store each value into gfilter which is a one d array
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 2:34 PM",No,To go from a 2 d to a 1d use row * width + column
+12064847887,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:09 PM",Yes,for calculate GFilter the size of the array can change because of the sigma value irhgt? so if the sigma value is 10 it has to be a 30x30 array?
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:30 PM",No,No 
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:30 PM",No,Never mind your right
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:30 PM",No,Get radius changes due to sigma
+18473739392,"Mar 18, 2014, 3:30 PM",No,So the radius of the filter changes
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2013, 8:22 PM",Yes,
+12064847887,"Dec 16, 2013, 10:54 AM",Yes,hey doug its chris doÊÊu understand condition codes?
+18472041937,"Dec 16, 2013, 10:54 AM",No,"Yeah. It's what you told me last night, right?"
+12064847887,"Dec 16, 2013, 10:57 AM",Yes,IÕm still in nugent btw 
+18472041937,"Dec 16, 2013, 10:57 AM",No,I'm at grainger
+12064847887,"Dec 16, 2013, 10:57 AM",Yes,IÕm looking at the notes and there are more than just 000 and 001 though
+18472041937,"Dec 16, 2013, 10:57 AM",No,010 is branch. I've never seen anything else used
+12064847887,"Dec 16, 2013, 11:00 AM",Yes,ok 
+12064847887,"Dec 16, 2013, 11:00 AM",Yes,also do u know what it means for IRD to be 1 lol
+18472041937,"Dec 16, 2013, 11:02 AM",No,No idea lol. 
+18472041937,"Dec 16, 2013, 11:04 AM",No,Oh IRD is 1 for branch
+12064847887,"Dec 16, 2013, 11:19 AM",Yes,Oh k so if branch IRD is one and conditions are 010
+12064847887,"Dec 16, 2013, 11:19 AM",Yes,For memory it's IRD 0 and conditions 001. 
+12064847887,"Dec 16, 2013, 11:19 AM",Yes,For anything else IRD 0 and conditions 000
+18472041937,"Feb 11, 2014, 3:08 PM",No,"Hey, do you want to meet at siebel once you finish 198?"

cbchan2@illinois.edu,"Sep 28, 2013, 3:44 PM",No,"Jeremy Brett describes actors, with the collaboration of writers, as the explorers of the meaning, futility, and the beauty of life. Personally, I do agree to a very shallow extent. Actors, are often the common persons role model and aspiration. Many actors live affluent lifestyles and represent the inner desires of people. The common person is often limited by resources. Actors, often make exorbitant amounts of money and make personal decisions that the common person would not be able to. This could be spending copious amounts of money on new cars and houses or donating millions to research or humanitarian societies. As well, sometimes, the characters the actors play represent ulterior motives. In the movie horrible bosses, for example, three characters are set out to kill their bosses. In reality, for many, this would be out of the question, but, at the same time, thoughts of getting back at their bosses is typically not out of the question. At the same time, I don't agree with Jeremy Brett's position that actors have precedence over soldiers, government, and businessmen. Theater and acting is viewed by people as a past time or hobby. I believe that without acting, people would be able to move on with their lives much more securely than without government. I believe that actors such as Brad Pitt become such household names because of talent and social media. AlthoughÊ"

+12064847887,"Feb 23, 2014, 12:12 AM",Yes,Go to sleep night
+14252334939,"Feb 23, 2014, 12:12 AM",No,Mup
+14252334939,"Feb 25, 2014, 9:50 AM",No,Can you do parallax coding 
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 9:52 AM",Yes,U mean parallax effects on websites?
+14252334939,"Feb 25, 2014, 9:52 AM",No,Yeah 
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 9:52 AM",Yes,And yah but I only know how to do it via existing libraries
+14252334939,"Feb 25, 2014, 9:52 AM",No,o
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 9:52 AM",Yes,Coding that all myself would be difficult. But for a short answer yes I can
+14252334939,"Feb 25, 2014, 9:52 AM",No,It is very very cool 
+14252334939,"Feb 25, 2014, 9:52 AM",No,U should do it for ur website 
+14252334939,"Feb 25, 2014, 9:54 AM",No,At work we are rebranding a local IT consulting firm and we want to give them parallax stuff for their new website
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 9:59 AM",Yes,Yah I'll think about it. Parallax leads to unnecessary lag most of the time. U gotta remember the client doesn't always have the fastest internet but I'll see if I can. I finish up exams and hard stuff but this Friday. If I have time ill text u. Send me more info when u can 
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 9:59 AM",Yes,Give me a layout of what u want it to be like too.  
+14252334939,"Feb 25, 2014, 9:59 AM",No,How does parallax work? Is it a unique coding language or just an effect?
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 9:59 AM",Yes,It's using CSS
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:00 AM",Yes,and javascript in tandem
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:00 AM",Yes,Normally required a jquery library and a standalone. Uses a lot of space most of the time. There are simple parallax effects and more complex ones. 
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:00 AM",Yes,On scroll events aren't too bad 
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:01 AM",Yes,Example as u scroll down things fade in and crap
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:01 AM",Yes,anyways i would be glad to help out when i have the time.
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:01 AM",Yes,i have a CS exam today worth 22% of my grade
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:01 AM",Yes,just finished my ECE exam yesterday worth 23%
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:01 AM",Yes,and other ECE exam on thursday so yah lots of stress
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:01 AM",Yes,and then a big coding assignment due friday and analog signal hw due wednesday and asian american studies which is a a joke but still requires about an hour to do worth of hw
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:03 AM",Yes,so yah yah yah i gotta work on that first. but once again send me the website link give me a layout of what u want to do 
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:03 AM",Yes,and ill try this weekend
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:03 AM",Yes,and know that my friends have asked me to do this for their clubs before but i was too lazy. Ill do it for u because u are my sister but be easier on mama and dada if i do this
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:03 AM",Yes,only condition
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:05 AM",Yes,some poorly done website but the behind the scenes js is what u want anyways ill give u some examples here of standalone libraries i would use
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:05 AM",Yes,https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:07 AM",Yes,http://razorfish.github.io/Parallax-JS/#foo
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:07 AM",Yes,the second link could work quite well i think
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:08 AM",Yes,http://tympanus.net/Blueprints/OnScrollEffectLayout/
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:10 AM",Yes,this template could work perfectly as well
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:10 AM",Yes,http://startbootstrap.com/templates/stylish-portfolio/
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:10 AM",Yes,i could edit up the color scheme change the photos and add more slides but it could work
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:10 AM",Yes,anyways look at the links tell me what u think. i gotta get back to studying. i went to the library to avoid people talking to me in the dorm so i could concentrate gotta concentrate here. anyways text me after 9PM central aka 7pm pacific and we can talk more about it
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:10 AM",Yes,and if im doing this i want this to be a learning experience for u too so we are using github 
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:12 AM",Yes,for collaborative coding
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:12 AM",Yes,so u can edit things to ur liking. it will help ur resume immensely. 
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:20 AM",Yes,also u need to consider how editable they want it to be. If i use wordpress and templates they can edit the content easily
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:20 AM",Yes,"if i make custom HTML CSS JS they have to go into the source code to edit it, which for most poeple they dont know how to do "
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:20 AM",Yes,then again it is an IT departmnet but still just somerhing to consider
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 10:20 AM",Yes,and well i wouldnt say most poeple but for ease and usability its easier to use something like wordpress. wordpress has a billion themes too
+14252334939,"Feb 25, 2014, 11:12 AM",No,WOWIE 
+14252334939,"Feb 25, 2014, 11:14 AM",No,yah we looked at razors is for inspiration
+14252334939,"Feb 25, 2014, 11:14 AM",No,*razorfish
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 11:14 AM",Yes,i dont think razor fish does a good job tbh
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 11:14 AM",Yes,http://www.cssdesignawards.com
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 11:14 AM",Yes,try this
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 11:14 AM",Yes,granted the people that make these are increidbly talented and well beyond my level but this is good inspiration
+14252334939,"Feb 25, 2014, 11:16 AM",No,"WOWIE this is helpful because I'm purely on the design side and the client is an IT firm they already know how to code, they actually supplied me a team of coders and I basically just tell them what to make from a purely aesthetic viewpoint...BUT so for previous clients they tried doing parallax and it failed because no one on the team knows how to code (they are all marketing people) and you can't really just manage from a purely aesthetic viewpoint if you want a complex website \LFSo yey this is Gud thank u brother chan"
+14252334939,"Feb 25, 2014, 11:18 AM",No,I looked at the awards link too last night 
+14252334939,"Feb 25, 2014, 11:18 AM",No,Too cool 
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 11:23 AM",Yes,I'm confused so this client knows how to code already? So what do u need me to do lol
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 11:23 AM",Yes,Oh I c 
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 11:23 AM",Yes,U want me to do it for mine
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 11:23 AM",Yes,Cuz ur client is doing it
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 11:24 AM",Yes,Parallax on a personal website is generally a bad idea though unless I make it really well. It normally leads to unnecessary clutter and loading times. 
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 11:24 AM",Yes,Though people that make it work make it beautiful b
+14252334939,"Feb 25, 2014, 11:26 AM",No,o yah i donÕt need you to code anything for me but i was just wondering about it 
+14252334939,"Feb 25, 2014, 11:26 AM",No,to see if its possible
+14252334939,"Feb 25, 2014, 11:26 AM",No,also it would be cool if you have time to teach me how to do some or if i could show you ideas i have for my client and you tell me how feasible it is with parallax
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 11:28 AM",Yes,yah just send it to me after 9 pm central\LF7pm pacific
+14252334939,"Feb 25, 2014, 11:29 AM",No,kewill

+14252334939,"Feb 25, 2014, 11:30 AM",No,last night was the first review and i presented a bunch of logos i worked real hard on and they liked some of them so yay 
+14252334939,"Feb 25, 2014, 11:30 AM",No,o ok whenever is fine
+14252334939,"Feb 25, 2014, 11:31 AM",No,"cus again they know how to code, IÕm just asking so i have a better idea of whats possible/feasible and whats not "
+12064847887,"Feb 25, 2014, 11:31 AM",Yes,ya but do u know how good they are?

+12064847887,"Aug 15, 2013, 11:47 PM",Yes,see we used to talk about food and tv and stuff
+12063938290,"Aug 15, 2013, 11:47 PM",No,Well then just tell me! Sheesh I feel like that's what I whole relationship was built on!
+12063938290,"Aug 15, 2013, 11:47 PM",No,Especially starting this school year!

+12063938290,"Aug 15, 2013, 11:47 PM",No,Not clearly enough
+12063938290,"Aug 15, 2013, 11:49 PM",No,Just be straight up instead of blowing me off
+12064847887,"Aug 15, 2013, 11:49 PM",Yes,sorry
+12064847887,"Aug 15, 2013, 11:49 PM",Yes,but
+12064847887,"Aug 15, 2013, 11:49 PM",Yes,past like 5 times were all honest 
+12064847887,"Aug 15, 2013, 11:49 PM",Yes,actually all were honest
+12063938290,"Aug 15, 2013, 11:49 PM",No,Cuz one of the things that frustrated me the most is that every time I talk about something emotional you just brush me off saying I'm too emotional well duh I know and by you saying that it makes it seem like you don't care which is what I've been trying to figure out this entire time!
+12063938290,"Aug 15, 2013, 11:49 PM",No,What do you mean past 5 times?
+12064847887,"Aug 15, 2013, 11:49 PM",Yes,i say that because i have nothing else to say cuz i dont know what to say cuz im bad at that 
+12064847887,"Aug 15, 2013, 11:49 PM",Yes,well the vision and the parents telling me no
+12064847887,"Aug 15, 2013, 11:51 PM",Yes,and the yadiyadiya i dont remember exactly but i havent lied to u before
+12063938290,"Aug 15, 2013, 11:51 PM",No,Oh yeah okay
+12063938290,"Aug 15, 2013, 11:52 PM",No,But sometimes you have to realize that though you may be bad at stuff it comes across a certain way 
+12064847887,"Aug 15, 2013, 11:52 PM",Yes,but u get me
+12063938290,"Aug 15, 2013, 11:52 PM",No,Like I'm bad at hiding how I feel and it makes other people feel uncomfortable so I have to realize that and suppress it more
+12063938290,"Aug 15, 2013, 11:53 PM",No,Yes I do get you and you get me but at the same time we both annoy each other
+12064847887,"Aug 15, 2013, 11:53 PM",Yes,just remember whenever i say ur too emotional its because i have no clue what to say
+12063938290,"Aug 15, 2013, 11:54 PM",No,"Well please stop saying that cuz it just reminds me that yeah I do care to much but no matter how much I know you and your intentions by you saying to me it sounds like ""I don't know what to do with you and I'm not even going to bother"""
+12064847887,"Aug 15, 2013, 11:57 PM",Yes,k
+12063938290,"Aug 15, 2013, 11:58 PM",No,This is exactly why i didn't want to do this over text
+12063938290,"Aug 15, 2013, 11:59 PM",No,Cuz I'm not mad at you but I need you to know how I feel as much as I need to know how you feel
+12064847887,"Aug 16, 2013, 12:00 AM",Yes,I feel a lot less than you do
+12064847887,"Aug 16, 2013, 12:00 AM",Yes,A loooottttt less
+12063938290,"Aug 16, 2013, 12:00 AM",No,Yeah you feel a lot less but that doesn't mean you don't think about stuff
+12064847887,"Aug 16, 2013, 12:05 AM",Yes,barely
+12063938290,"Aug 16, 2013, 12:06 AM",No,Okay fine then I'm the one who does most of the thinking

+12064847887,"Aug 16, 2013, 12:06 AM",Yes,i just think there needs to be a better balance of things that we talk about 
+12064847887,"Aug 16, 2013, 12:07 AM",Yes,i enjoy talking to you about stuff liek that at times because ur the only one i can talk to about it
+12063938290,"Aug 16, 2013, 12:07 AM",No,Fine I'll try 
+12064847887,"Aug 16, 2013, 12:08 AM",Yes,just too much sometimes thats all i meant
+12064847887,"Aug 16, 2013, 12:08 AM",Yes,what?
+12063938290,"Aug 16, 2013, 12:08 AM",No,Like I don't want to talk about shallow stuff either

+12064847887,"Aug 16, 2013, 12:09 AM",Yes,I don't understand where the elise thing came from but I'm just gonna ignore that
+12064847887,"Aug 16, 2013, 12:09 AM",Yes,Yeah idk we can figure it out
+12063938290,"Aug 16, 2013, 12:08 AM",No,Cuz you were saying how you could talk to her about anything and you had so much in common well I'm not like that
+12064847887,"Aug 16, 2013, 12:10 AM",Yes,Oh. Yeah say that instead
+12063938290,"Aug 16, 2013, 12:10 AM",No,Okayyyy but I still am annoyed how you refuse to ft me

+14252334939,"Oct 8, 2013, 9:21 PM",No,"It wasn't actually an interview. So the first thing was the Microsoft thing and it was actually only for sales club members so I basically accidentally joined sales club which is cool. It was a large information session aimed at juniors and seniors who are looking to be recruited for actual jobs instead of internships, which is why I was the only freshman...But that's okay I still left my resume with them and hopefully made an impression by having some face to face contact after when I asked them questions. Also today was a free meeting for sales club but appRently there's a $45 membership fee and if I pay it I'm officially a member, which means I get to go to an exclusive info/recruitment session on Thursday with Google!! And maybe that one will have internship opportunities. \LF\LFThe next thing was a networking workshop hosted by the business fraternity I might join. It was with a panel of actual business professionals and recruiters from companies like Liberty Mutual and KPMG who gave you one on one advice on networking and helped you on public speaking and refining your resume. Very helpful. Also there was a woman working for Concur Tech who said in the process of asking for networking advice and questions I basically marketed myself to her and she said she was really impressed and asked me to contact her through email and visit their booth at the next career fair in January!

+12064847887,"Mar 9, 2014, 11:28 PM",Yes,if IÕm just sticking with web dev stuff IÕm unsure. Visa IÕm just a QA intern though 
+12064847887,"Mar 9, 2014, 11:28 PM",Yes,which is still good but its like a lower tier developer title even though i do the same things

+12064847887,"Mar 10, 2014, 8:35 PM",Yes,except the co-pilot did it and killed the pilot

+12064847887,"Apr 27, 2013, 8:04 PM",Yes,but from what im reading most people just say their ECE gpa which is just their gpa from specifically ECE courses

Our circuit wouldn't work properly. We couldn't get it to work on time. Lab tas were huge jerks and wouldn't let us change the car. We got dinged hard on it. I'm gonna get an A - in that class for something that wasn't even my fault. Or worse a B+
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:27 PM",Yes,And my exam scores are top of the class too. It is complete bs. But I can't do anything. I already complained and argued to them and they didn't do anything
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:28 PM",Yes,It's hard to get into details but legitimately this was %100 their fault. I was perfect on my end and we lost in the end

+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:28 PM",No,Is this a team project or individual??
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:29 PM",Yes,The final at the very least was only 1/3 of the full final grade. Our report was 2/3. Group project. My partner was fine though. TAs were bad
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:30 PM",No,Both of you go talk to the prof after the final.
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:30 PM",Yes,yeah i might actually. it wasnt fair at all. we complained in our lab report a lot
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:30 PM",Yes,our schematic was flawless along with our wiring
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:30 PM",Yes,it was just flat out the car wasnt working
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:33 PM",No,Those **** happens. Show the schematic and be prepared to explain it would have worked Hadd not because of faulty hadware.
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:33 PM",No,The prof has heard this many times and do your homework up front and argue like hell. After the final
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:33 PM",No,"If you do we'll in the final and all your tests, the prof will know you are not trying to be"
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:33 PM",Yes,"i normalyl woudlnt be too mad except i was easily one of the better students in that class. that kid frmoo bellevue high school who is pretty dang good at math and physics is no where near as good as me in ECE or lab. its very frustrating to see kids who arent as good as me in things get much better scores anyways if i get a B+ in the class lemme just say that its not because im not good at this stuff cuz this stuff is really easy for me. in the last 5 minutes cuz my partner didnt know what to do and the teacher said if u can make a circuit in 5 minutes that can navigate the track up to splits, which required 4 sensors and color detection and some other things i dont want to delve into that i could try it again. and he was just joking cuz that seemed impossible to him and everyone else. i finished it in 6 mnutes"
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:33 PM",Yes,like i feel like im just innately good at this but its stupid because i dont get any credit for it. but yeah ill talk to the prof probably
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:37 PM",Yes,anyways my tech gpa sucks right now. im at a 2.85 
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:37 PM",Yes,and my cumulative after this semester could shoot down to a 3.1
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:37 PM",Yes,which means im just slightly above average in the entire school
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:38 PM",Yes,which means basically i can kiss my hopes of goldman sachs gone for now but its still possible in the future years. yes i know u guys said freshmen year is supposed to be the easiest but from what i heard from upper classmen there are a lot of kids that got the same gpa as me frosh year and 4.0s after so who knows. anyways once i take the online courses it goes up to a 3.33 which is a nice jump
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:39 PM",Yes,goldman sachs requires a 3.30 min but in reality im sure i need a 3.5 to get a shot 
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:39 PM",Yes,but i also decided that next semester i should really shoot for that ATT internship. its the most feasible for me to achieve especially cuz u work there and ATT is a gigantic company which will look great on my resume
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:39 PM",Yes,plus its in bellevue so its hard to beat
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:40 PM",Yes,but obviously ill have to get it first but i think ATT makes the most sense
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:41 PM",No,"Goldman Sach is the very top  and only a few are hired. You can still make it, you have 3 more years to prove yourself."
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:41 PM",No,Don't give up too soon.
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:41 PM",Yes,but anyways just so u guys know i havent played a single video game since spring break and i have been working very hard. but yeah stupid things happen but im really gonna work hard this summer to do better. yeah i think its still doable but i really wanted a financial internship early 
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:41 PM",No,Remember that will smith movie??
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:42 PM",No,He was hired at Bear Stern 
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:42 PM",Yes,but i think i realize now that i was going about these things the wrong way. u guys were right i should work for larger tech companies first before i go to the smaller ones or financial firms. 
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:42 PM",No,Chris you need to understand the financial industry is not like before.
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:42 PM",No,The crash killed many investment firm.
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:43 PM",No,The programmers they hired are by the high frequency trading firm.\LF
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:43 PM",Yes,yea i know that too. ive been doing a lot of research as to what i think will be the next future bubble. i was thinking electric cars for a while but Tesla apparantly has bad pay so i dont wanna work there. but they hire a lot from here cuz the CEO was from here. but yeah goldman is hiring high frequency trading programmers
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:43 PM",No,It is a very volatile industry
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:43 PM",Yes,from here i took their pamphlet. 
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:43 PM",Yes,yeah i know
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:44 PM",No,It is for short term career move. 
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:44 PM",Yes,but ive heard and read of a lot of people from gtech and uiuc going to goldman
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:44 PM",No,Not long term employment to earn a living
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:44 PM",Yes,and once i get goldman on my resume i should be set for other investment banks
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:45 PM",No,Investment banking hires very few computer engineering grads 
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:45 PM",No,You need to accept that.
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:45 PM",No,Getting hired by Goldman Sach is similar to hitting the jackpot. \LF
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:45 PM",No,Aim high is good but we need to be realistic at times
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:46 PM",No,There are very few get rich quick jobs
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:46 PM",Yes,well the nice thing is that a fwe people on goldmans board came from UIUC
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:46 PM",Yes,engineering too
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:47 PM",Yes,they have an entire hiring platform and office here so i think if anywhere this is the best place to get one
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:47 PM",No,Yes there are but how many?
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:47 PM",Yes,but yeah obviously if i dont get into goldman ill go somewhere else 
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:47 PM",No,3?\LF10?
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:47 PM",Yes,they need a lot to program the things they do i think
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:47 PM",No,"How many are hired by Google, Msft and apple?"
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:47 PM",Yes,but yeah its def really completive
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:48 PM",Yes,well Microsoft according to bill gate's speech in 2005 hires the most out of UIUC
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:48 PM",No,Don't worry about those now.
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:48 PM",Yes,and youtube which is owned by google came from uiuc as well
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:48 PM",No,Focus on present exams and do well.
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:48 PM",Yes,i mean hiring here is pretty good i just obviously have to get a better gpa
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:48 PM",No,And get a good internship
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:49 PM",Yes,i mean once again like remember im average in a top 5 engineering school. where does that make me compared to like the schools in the 15 range. plus imagine if i got my gpa to the 3.5 range
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:49 PM",Yes,yeah well thats what this summer is for
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:49 PM",No,To aboard to take a one semester study 
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:49 PM",Yes,i dont want to though and it would put me very far behind 
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:49 PM",No,Go aboard 
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:50 PM",Yes,and im not qualifiable for the full ride scholarship anymore
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:50 PM",Yes,uiuc doesnt have the same scholarship program as gtech either
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:50 PM",Yes,where they give u instate tuition
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:50 PM",No,Think long term!
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:50 PM",Yes,i dont think it will hepl me that much though i wanna take a lot of the CS courses early
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:50 PM",Yes,for internships
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:52 PM",No,Take one semester oversea. You will cherish it forever.
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:52 PM",No,It also looks good on resume.
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:54 PM",Yes,eh ill c. i dont really want tothough 
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:54 PM",Yes,anyways ive had to revamp my schedule because i obviously cant handle the courseload for next year
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:56 PM",Yes,so i took off analog signal processing. 
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:56 PM",Yes,now i just have a C programming/ assembly language class which takes up a lot of time but i already know C well. discrete math and differential equations with linear algebra
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 9:58 PM",No,I didn't take analog signal processing until my senior year.
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:00 PM",Yes,"essentially our courses go physics mechanics, E and M, thermal, quantum, for physics. math goes from adv calc to multivariable to differential equations + linear algebra in an accelerated engineering math course. well all the math courses are engineering. then i have after analog signal processing one C programming course and assembly language and some more logic gates and TTL stuff and V-HDL stuff with that course. then C++ object oriented programming more assembly language and TTL then after fields and waves EE course then comes x86 assembly and then after is that UNIX course where u make the opperating system and then its like a bunch more things i dont know and then finally its the class where we go to that nanochip lab and make semiconductors "
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:02 PM",Yes,and then on the side we have like discrete data structures and data structures and then like 6 CS tech electives
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:02 PM",Yes,and some stupid statistics engineering course. im gonna take a CS HCI course which is like a human user interface course my second semester soph year as one tech elective. i also want to get into security and encryption. we did basic encryption and compression in ECE 110 and i kinda like it. its like a security and networking course which is ur job
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:02 PM",Yes,if ur ever curious as to what courses im taking and stuff this website is whati use a lot its very helpful
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:02 PM",Yes,https://wiki.engr.illinois.edu/display/HKNDEN/Home
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:05 PM",Yes,and this
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:05 PM",Yes,http://www.ece.illinois.edu/students/ugrad/curriculum/ce-curriculum-06.html#comp
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:05 PM",No,Your freshman year will be easy when compared to your classes ahead.....
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:06 PM",No,Analog signal processing has lots and lots of math.\LF
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:06 PM",Yes,but at least ill be good at it. ECE is still by far my best course compared to physics and math and chem
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:06 PM",Yes,and ECE 110 u gotta rememer is a weed out course cuz u have to get at least a B in that course to transfer into ECE
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:06 PM",No,Digital signal process is math too but easier.
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:06 PM",No,Analog is all math and physics
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:07 PM",Yes,we;ve already dont like half of analog signal processing in ECE thouhg
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:07 PM",Yes,*done
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:07 PM",Yes,the first half is just review of the old stuff. we've done up to fourier transforms with analog signal processing
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:08 PM",No,Kinda surprised to see this class in your second year.
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:08 PM",No,As in every programming class.
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:09 PM",No,Learning the language syntax is only 2%!of the class.
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:09 PM",Yes,"i think the difference between here and uw is that at uw they spend more time on the foundamentals. like i know that wilbert and linsen took a year of java in CS, while here they kind of just assume u know it alreayd and just get into the harder stuff"
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:10 PM",No,80 % of the students should already know C.
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:10 PM",Yes,but yeah i know its not easy but ive helped my friend in the course for some of his programming assignments and its not bad
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:10 PM",Yes,i also downloaded all their hw 
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:10 PM",No,The algorithm design and documentation will takes hours
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:10 PM",No,85% of the time.\LF
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:10 PM",Yes,yeah i know but once again im pretty sure im much better at the upper level courses than i am at these courses right now
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:11 PM",No,Writing code is the easy part.
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:11 PM",Yes,well i mean if i know how to do the stuff in the class i should befine
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:11 PM",No,Designing portion is the hardest and longest.
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:11 PM",Yes,i already have the hw im really not worried about a programming course
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:12 PM",No,Just because a program producing the right output is not even half of the grade.
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:12 PM",Yes,especially cuz ill have a lot more experience with internships. im not a bad coder u know. im pretty good at it dont worry
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:12 PM",Yes,nope its 100% of the grade
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:12 PM",Yes,thats another thing that uw does differnetly
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:12 PM",Yes,than uiuc
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:12 PM",Yes,i sat in wilberts CS course
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:12 PM",No,That is the difference of computer engineering
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:12 PM",Yes,UW makes sure ur syntax is super neat and everything
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:12 PM",Yes,with no reptition
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:13 PM",Yes,UIUC exams literally are u get the result u get 100% u dont u get a 0%
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:13 PM",Yes,for the next class anywyays
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:13 PM",Yes,thats the style of the course
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:13 PM",No,"In real life, no one will buy a working product unless it is easy to use and fast!!"
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:13 PM",Yes,its good and bad. realsitically u cant write code thats crap
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:13 PM",Yes,yeah 
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:13 PM",Yes,exactly
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:13 PM",Yes,but dont worry. once again what im best at is coding
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:13 PM",No,You will know that soon.....
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:13 PM",Yes,ive coded since 10th grade already im pretty good at it
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:13 PM",Yes,ive already taken that matlab course
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:14 PM",No,Getting a c grade even though your program works.
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:14 PM",No,You have to count lines of code.
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:14 PM",No,And optimization 
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:15 PM",No,Hard stuff
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:15 PM",Yes,which wasnt an easy course. my final project we had to present in front of a class a program that loaded up the GDP data for all the countries in a gui interface with a bunch of graphical inputs and outputs. it was a 3d graph and everything. dont worry really coding is once again what im good at 
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:15 PM",No,Very labor intensive \LF
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:15 PM",No,"But if you can write, it will be natural."
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:15 PM",No,Like speaking.
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:15 PM",Yes,im good at it
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:15 PM",Yes,u really dont have to worry about that
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:15 PM",No,You will know soon.
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:15 PM",Yes,i already have what will be 2 summer worth of coding experience form the uw intenrships which is already harder code than these courses 
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:15 PM",No,"Before you know it, you just spent 10 hours."
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:15 PM",Yes,i mean once again i have a friend in CS and ive done his hw for him before 
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:16 PM",Yes,theres a reason why i wanted to switch to cs
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:16 PM",No,Then you realize you still have other 4 courses to do homework!!
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:16 PM",Yes,coding is by far what im best at
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:16 PM",No,Time mgmt becomes a killer.
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:16 PM",Yes,yes i know i alreayd took that matlab course really i know
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:17 PM",Yes,once again and again coding is what im good at
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:17 PM",No,You also need business skills.
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:17 PM",Yes,coding for me is like what wiring circuits and looking at logic diagrams is for me. it just makes sense in my head quickly
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:17 PM",No,Tech is not enough .
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:17 PM",Yes,yeah im thinking of taking a Business technical writing course next semester
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:17 PM",Yes,its very easy too
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:17 PM",No,Take that free leadership camp during the weekends
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:17 PM",Yes,that was at gtech not here
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:19 PM",Yes,once again u gotta remember this is a top 5 engineering school. everyone here is a gigantic nerd. very few people have social skills as is. the competition is not rough 
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:19 PM",No,I really wish you listened and sign up the series during the last semester. Still not too late.
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:19 PM",Yes,ill be fine i can talk to people just fine dont worry
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:19 PM",No,That's why they offer leadership courses. 
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:19 PM",No,Take them.
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:19 PM",Yes,gotta remember i came here knowing no one and its not like i had no friends 
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:19 PM",No,You won't regret.
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:19 PM",Yes,but its the time thats the issue

+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:20 PM",No,That's how you get jobs.
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:20 PM",Yes,if i get credit for it
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:20 PM",No,Need to listen to your parents on these things.
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:20 PM",No,Will be much easier for you to get intrviews and jobs down the road
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:21 PM",No,It's like 3 hours on each Saturday morning.
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:21 PM",No,You have time.
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:21 PM",No,Just need to make them.
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:21 PM",Yes,ill c
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:22 PM",No,"I bet you at least ""wasting"" 2 to 3 hours a day.\LF"
+14257492034,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:22 PM",No,All those time on facebook.
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:22 PM",Yes,no time for that
+12064847887,"Apr 29, 2013, 10:22 PM",Yes,i have one day off every week thats friday

+12064847887,"May 2, 2013, 11:29 AM",Yes,Everyone I know that went to USC had half ride at least. 
+12066126652,"May 2, 2013, 11:29 AM",No,She said why we forced her to go UW
+12064847887,"May 2, 2013, 11:30 AM",Yes,She forced herself we told her a long time ago u have to get a scholarship there if u wana go
+12064847887,"May 2, 2013, 11:30 AM",Yes,She didn't apply for the correct deadline
+12066126652,"May 2, 2013, 11:29 AM",No,I know and we couldn't because we make too much
+12064847887,"May 2, 2013, 11:30 AM",Yes,Those scholarships are purely merit
+12066126652,"May 2, 2013, 11:30 AM",No,Not true
+12064847887,"May 2, 2013, 11:31 AM",Yes,The ones for the December deadline are.  The big ones
+12064847887,"May 2, 2013, 11:31 AM",Yes,The ones that are half and full off
+12066126652,"May 2, 2013, 11:31 AM",No,They asked her what other the family had to pay so they are considering income for sure
+12064847887,"May 2, 2013, 11:32 AM",Yes,Remember that is for the later scholarship. The main big ones are in the December deadline for which she did not apply
+12064847887,"May 2, 2013, 11:32 AM",Yes,Those large half full off are purely merit
+12064847887,"May 2, 2013, 11:32 AM",Yes,For December deadline
+12066126652,"May 2, 2013, 11:33 AM",No,That is her fault then 
+12064847887,"May 2, 2013, 11:33 AM",Yes,That was my point
+12064847887,"May 2, 2013, 11:33 AM",Yes,We told her a long time ago
+12066126652,"May 2, 2013, 11:33 AM",No,Anyway.  She said she would get a loan so don't understand why we forced her to UW
+12064847887,"May 2, 2013, 11:33 AM",Yes,She said she wanted to get her recs better. I told her it makes almost no difference.  
+12066126652,"May 2, 2013, 11:33 AM",No,She is not being rational 
+12066126652,"May 2, 2013, 11:33 AM",No,Yeah
+12064847887,"May 2, 2013, 11:34 AM",Yes,Loans have huge interest rates. She would never be able to afford it. It's not like u can get interhships that pay a lot early either. USC business school is not what it used to be. 10 years ago it was a top 10 program. Then five years ago they changed their business dean and the rsnkings have fallen considerably since
+12064847887,"May 2, 2013, 11:35 AM",Yes,The kids that get in now are just above average. 
+12064847887,"May 2, 2013, 11:35 AM",Yes,It's not what it used to be. Read the news articles
+12064847887,"May 2, 2013, 11:35 AM",Yes,She needs to
+12064847887,"May 2, 2013, 11:37 AM",Yes,And besides she tanked her grades so badly she will be lucky if USC wouldn't have rescinded her
+12064847887,"May 2, 2013, 11:37 AM",Yes,Uw is a MUCH better business program now. 
+12064847887,"May 2, 2013, 11:38 AM",Yes,I'm not saying this cuz she has to go to uw. I told Lucas this all the time
+12064847887,"May 2, 2013, 11:38 AM",Yes,Uw has risen 7 spots in the past three years
+12064847887,"May 2, 2013, 11:38 AM",Yes,It's now a top 15-20 program. 
+14257492034,"May 2, 2013, 10:42 PM",No,"Chris, finals. So far so good??"

wilbertthelam@gmail.com,"Aug 31, 2013, 1:30 PM",No,looks like Iraq all over again
+12064847887,"Aug 31, 2013, 1:31 PM",Yes,Us needs to stop acting like we are the worlds police
+14257365590,"Aug 31, 2013, 1:30 PM",No,US is the world police
wilbertthelam@gmail.com,"Aug 31, 2013, 1:30 PM",No,why does there even need to be a world police at all
+14257365590,"Aug 31, 2013, 1:30 PM",No,Well it looks like there's enough evidence this time though for the usage of these weapons
+14257365590,"Aug 31, 2013, 1:30 PM",No,Because of countries like North Korea and Syria
+14257365590,"Aug 31, 2013, 1:33 PM",No,They just have to avoid getting entrenched in a long standoff
+12064847887,"Aug 31, 2013, 1:34 PM",Yes,When I think about what they are doing here I think more about the fact that Syria has ties with Russia and Iran. Us does not need to be directly involved. They should just be providing aid and support. 
+12064847887,"Aug 31, 2013, 1:34 PM",Yes,There's a reason a lot of other countries like the uk backed out of supporting the us
+14257365590,"Aug 31, 2013, 1:35 PM",No,"Well neither Russia nor Iran are exactly great supporters of US, and have been helping to keep up the Syrian government"
+12064847887,"Aug 31, 2013, 1:36 PM",Yes,Yeah that was my point. It's Syrias ties with those countries that makes me believe is a main driving force as to why the us is acting the way it is. Especially after the whole Iran us nuclear weapons crap recently. 
+14257365590,"Aug 31, 2013, 1:37 PM",No,"Well Obama did promise a year (or two) ago that he would not tolerate the use of chemical weapons in the war, and that the US would intervene in such a case."
wilbertthelam@gmail.com,"Aug 31, 2013, 1:37 PM",No,Interesting how Obama claims they won't send in US ground forces tho
+14257365590,"Aug 31, 2013, 1:39 PM",No,"I don't think it's such a bad idea. The civil war itself has already killed 100,000 people"
+14257365590,"Aug 31, 2013, 1:40 PM",No,"I this helps it to end quickly, then all the better"
wilbertthelam@gmail.com,"Aug 31, 2013, 1:40 PM",No,Btw addy kev can't come
+14257365590,"Aug 31, 2013, 1:41 PM",No,"Also, with all of Russia's anti-American talk, they don't have the balls to stand up to the US military, they're not the USSR anymore..."
+12064847887,"Aug 31, 2013, 1:41 PM",Yes,I don't think it's a bad idea I just don't think it's a good one either. The sad truth is sendin ground troops for 10  21 year kids to die is cheaper than sending a middle to blow up two people. 
+12064847887,"Aug 31, 2013, 1:41 PM",Yes,Russia has better diplomatic ties from what I've read with the USA lately anyways. 
+14257365590,"Aug 31, 2013, 1:42 PM",No,Well as long as they don't send ground troops to Syria I don't think there would be a lot of US casualties
+14257365590,"Aug 31, 2013, 1:43 PM",No,I honestly can't see such an operation being popular
+12064847887,"Aug 31, 2013, 1:44 PM",Yes,It's just very expensive using drones and air strikes. Yeah true but I still think there are better alternatives out there

wilbertthelam@gmail.com,"Aug 31, 2013, 2:00 PM",No,LOL either we thik the same or Gary is just really predictable
+12069924635,"Aug 31, 2013, 2:00 PM",No,They would be the best double agents. Cause they would genuinely try to help the opposition. But they would just fuck everything up
wilbertthelam@gmail.com,"Aug 31, 2013, 2:00 PM",No,LOL
+14257365590,"Aug 31, 2013, 2:00 PM",No,But we want the opposition to win

+12064847887,"Sep 6, 2013, 6:35 PM",Yes,yeah i read that but its not like the US is decreasing in world presence.

The US is going to be the worlds super power because we have the most advanced weapon systems anyways. 
+14257365590,"Sep 6, 2013, 6:36 PM",No,"Well sending a message now in Syria could deter many more upstarts, avoiding bloodshed in the future"
+12064847887,"Sep 6, 2013, 6:38 PM",Yes,but think about the end results. look at countries like egypt. 
+14257365590,"Sep 6, 2013, 6:38 PM",No,US didn't bomb Egypt though
+12064847887,"Sep 6, 2013, 6:42 PM",Yes,"no but the US aided the rebels during Egypt's uprising. In this case with Syria after the bombings and when we overtake syria's government im sure the US will want some western ideology in their governments, such as democracy. When I think of that I think of egypt"

+14257365590,"Sep 6, 2013, 6:55 PM",No,"Well US is not planning on taking over the government. The strike is not even intended to take down the government, only to reduce the capabilities of the government to we chemical weapons"
+12064847887,"Sep 6, 2013, 6:57 PM",Yes,i mean sure but its definetly not out of the question that the US would be interested in meddling in syria even further when it comes to their government
+14257365590,"Sep 6, 2013, 6:58 PM",No,Eh well US promised to avoid any ground troops
+14257365590,"Sep 6, 2013, 6:59 PM",No,So I doubt it will get more involved.

+14257365590,"Sep 6, 2013, 7:03 PM",No,Well the Egyptian military got the aid. And as long as the American troops aren't in Syria I don't see a problem with it
+14257365590,"Sep 6, 2013, 7:03 PM",No,US sends aid to many countries
+12064847887,"Sep 6, 2013, 7:05 PM",Yes,from what i remember reading it was the entire government that received aid. Yeah but when you bomb a country money is going to be more important to them than other countries. 
+12064847887,"Sep 6, 2013, 7:05 PM",Yes,plus the costs too. Right now our economy is pretty stable. Increasing spending like this has immediate effects on the economy.
+14257365590,"Sep 6, 2013, 7:08 PM",No,"They're already going to be desperate, Syria is a wreck"
+14257365590,"Sep 6, 2013, 7:08 PM",No,US is probably gonna end up giving aid either way

chrischris292@yahoo.com,"Sep 28, 2013, 3:44 PM",Yes,"Jeremy Brett describes actors, with the collaboration of writers, as the explorers of the meaning, futility, and the beauty of life. Personally, I do agree to a very shallow extent. Actors, are often the common persons role model and aspiration. Many actors live affluent lifestyles and represent the inner desires of people. The common person is often limited by resources. Actors, often make exorbitant amounts of money and make personal decisions that the common person would not be able to. This could be spending copious amounts of money on new cars and houses or donating millions to research or humanitarian societies. As well, sometimes, the characters the actors play represent ulterior motives. In the movie horrible bosses, for example, three characters are set out to kill their bosses. In reality, for many, this would be out of the question, but, at the same time, thoughts of getting back at their bosses is typically not out of the question. At the same time, I don't agree with Jeremy Brett's position that actors have precedence over soldiers, government, and businessmen. Theater and acting is viewed by people as a past time or hobby. I believe that without acting, people would be able to move on with their lives much more securely than without government. I believe that actors such as Brad Pitt become such household names because of talent and social media. AlthoughÊ"

+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 6:09 PM",Yes,right now the US economy is doing great because obama is continuously feeding money into the system but economic cycles are normally about every 4 years and its about time for another drop so who knows
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 6:09 PM",Yes,but i will warn u haha one thing investors honestly dont value video game stocks like EA or ATVI very high
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 6:10 PM",Yes,if u look at the flucuation of ATVI is very marginal. EA has dropped a lot cuz of its bad PR too
+12062805027,"Jun 24, 2013, 6:10 PM",No,"Yeah, but it's promising with all the stuff they're announcing"
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 6:10 PM",Yes,and remember video game consoles always cost more to manufacture than sell they normally lose money during video game console releases haha 
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 6:10 PM",Yes,but i would look into AMD if were u
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 6:11 PM",Yes,i would watch EA. i invested in EA a while back and its not a bad idea imo but personally because of my bad experiences with EA im nto gonna touch that stock
+12062805027,"Jun 24, 2013, 6:11 PM",No,"Yeah, idk I'm still thinking about it."
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 6:12 PM",Yes,play around on investopedia if ur scared haha
+12062805027,"Jun 24, 2013, 6:12 PM",No,I'm getting a bonus soon at work which is about 700$ and idk what to do with it haha

+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 6:12 PM",Yes,i think the min amount for most accounts is 1000

+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 6:25 PM",Yes,"investopedia has a simulator where u can play around 100,000 and invest"
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 6:25 PM",Yes,with real values
+12062805027,"Jun 24, 2013, 6:25 PM",No,Oh so it's a simulator. Does Scott trade offer activision AMD and ea?
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 6:27 PM",Yes,yeah u can buy any stock on nasdaq from scottrade
+12062805027,"Jun 24, 2013, 6:36 PM",No,So amd is promising?
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 6:37 PM",Yes,i like amd but haha i mean ive been wrong before
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 6:38 PM",Yes,i mean if the market fails in some way say if the US launched some attack on syria or north korea prematurely launched a small attack on south korea or another earthquake happened in japan i mean really just anything lol
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 6:39 PM",Yes,haha its all intertwined. hence why im not really keen on any stock beyond what i already have in my portfolio im just watching AMD
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 6:39 PM",Yes,i think though from my research AMD is a good buy. owns essentially the video game industry. chip manufacturing normally has not very good profit margins however but as long as the xbox one and/or the ps4 sell well they make money plus AMD has changed their leadership recently from the crap it used to be in
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 6:40 PM",Yes,"and AMD makes almost no money, as a matter a fact they have been bleeding money for a while, which means it has huge room for improvement. "
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 6:40 PM",Yes,stocks are about growth and AMD i think personally has huge upside but i mean lol once again ive been wrong before but thats kind of like a short quick summary of what ive read abotu AMD 
+12062805027,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:12 PM",No,Lol are you invested into it
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:22 PM",Yes,to AMD? ive just read some things haha
+12062805027,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:39 PM",No,What companies do you recommend
+12062805027,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:44 PM",No,You gotta be approved for scottstrade?
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:44 PM",Yes,approved? idk lol my dad gave me the account

+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:45 PM",Yes,some companies im banking on failing

+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:47 PM",Yes,its kind of hard to explain haha if i could tell u face to face its easier but essentially its a derivitive
+12062805027,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:47 PM",No,Heh?
+12062805027,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:47 PM",No,So it's a fee?
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:48 PM",Yes,thats what its called a financial derivitive is an asset with a bunch of underlying assets so example being like nasdaq is a derivitive cuz it has a bunch of stocks like apple and google and yadiya

+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:48 PM",Yes,thats why its nic
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:48 PM",Yes,"ETF's typically are things that cover like the US market, or the gold supply, or like the tech sector"
+12062805027,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:50 PM",No,So it's a fee or what is it?
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:50 PM",Yes,no its like essentially an investment
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:50 PM",Yes,on anything

+12062805027,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:50 PM",No,Type of stock?
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:50 PM",Yes,think about it as a stock more simply. its a stock that instead of investing on one company u are investing on an entire sector
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:50 PM",Yes,except in reality its not a stock haha btu thats one way to look at it
+12062805027,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:52 PM",No,Oh those big companies
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:52 PM",Yes,not really a big company. multiple companies
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:52 PM",Yes,example there is an ETF that is purely on the tech sector
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:52 PM",Yes,which would include apple google blah blah
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:52 PM",Yes,all put into a single value that fluctuates via some algorithm on the side that incooperates the values of every company in the tech industry
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:54 PM",Yes,lol another way of putting it more simply is if u know what an index fund is its liek that
+12062805027,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:54 PM",No,So just a collab of companies represented by 1 name.
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:54 PM",Yes,yup in a really simple sense 
+12062805027,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:59 PM",No,So why does the stock market close?
+12062805027,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:59 PM",No,
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:59 PM",Yes,haha well i mean people can only work for so long

+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:59 PM",Yes,when u look at stock values they have this thing on the bottom saying after hours trading value
+12062805027,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:59 PM",No,So they charge you more for after hours probably right?
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 7:59 PM",Yes,i dont remmeber exactly haha

+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 8:04 PM",Yes,thats 7/1000 or .7% of ur earnings gone.
+12062805027,"Jun 24, 2013, 8:04 PM",No,"Well not live off of it, just make a quick buck"
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 8:04 PM",Yes,u double that for buy and sell and thats .14% and thats if u invest everything on one stock which is risky
+12062805027,"Jun 24, 2013, 8:04 PM",No,Have something making me money 
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 8:04 PM",Yes,so say u earn 15% which would be a great month. that wuld be about 14% earnings or $140
+12064847887,"Jun 24, 2013, 8:05 PM",Yes,its a nice thing to do on the side haha is what im saying btu a quick buck would need more money
+12062805027,"Jun 24, 2013, 8:05 PM",No,Yeah but it gets that much sketchier

+12064847887,"Jul 17, 2013, 11:54 AM",Yes,But for general CPU chips intel is the largest
+12062805027,"Jul 17, 2013, 11:54 AM",No,Does intel do phone chips or nah?

+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 8:48 PM",Yes,strike price is the price you place on a stock when u have an option on it where u sell or buy depending on whether you have a put or call on it
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 8:49 PM",Yes,if u wanna learn more about it understanding what an option is would help
+12062805027,"Jul 18, 2013, 8:49 PM",No,What's a put and a call?
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 8:49 PM",Yes,options btw are a good way of investing. a bit safer imo but its lal relative

+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 8:50 PM",Yes,a put option is where you set a strike price and if the stock reaches that value u sell the stock
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 8:50 PM",Yes,a put option is where you buy at the strike price when it reaches that value
+12062805027,"Jul 18, 2013, 8:50 PM",No,Is there a way you can have the system buy your stock when it hits a certain price?
+12062805027,"Jul 18, 2013, 8:50 PM",No,Oh so a put is ^

+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 8:56 PM",Yes,they can teach u a lot of these things. its how i learned it in high school
+12062805027,"Jul 18, 2013, 8:56 PM",No,I'm reading it but I don't get the terminology
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 8:58 PM",Yes,so haha ok finished uhm buy to open buy to close i dont really know to be honest. i havent been able to play around with options before
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 8:58 PM",Yes,my dad taught me a while back but i think i forgot already
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 8:58 PM",Yes,investopedia might help? haha but idk if the terminology is confusing for that as well
+12062805027,"Jul 18, 2013, 8:58 PM",No,And AON?
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:01 PM",Yes,haha what about it? its a company
+12062805027,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:01 PM",No,"Nah it's all or nothing, what's that for?"
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:01 PM",Yes,hmmm nevver heard of that before. i can look it up haha one sec
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:03 PM",Yes,ok so its just like if u invest a certain amount of stocks in a company u have to sell that order in its entirety. so every stock must be sold. or the other way around. its a contract
+12062805027,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:03 PM",No,"How bout in the case if I'm buying, not selling"
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:03 PM",Yes,its kind of a non factor now though. a lot of companies dont do that
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:05 PM",Yes,if you buy a stock u have to sell in its entirety essentially. u sign a contract. normally there would be some time 
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:05 PM",Yes,u have to do it by
+12062805027,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:05 PM",No,How about buy to close and open
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:05 PM",Yes,haha honestly that stuff is something only a stock brokerage would do. its not for the common investor cuz of the starting costs on this
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:05 PM",Yes,but buying to close is essentially giving up on ur short position on an option
+12062805027,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:07 PM",No,"So lets say I'm tryna buy 50 shares of something when the price per share hits 4$, would I have to touch those. "
+12062805027,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:07 PM",No,Like is there a way I can do that?
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:07 PM",Yes,uhhh what do u mean? like do u want it to do something when u hit that price?
+12062805027,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:07 PM",No,Ya
+12062805027,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:07 PM",No,So when the stock drops to 4$ I have a system to buy 50 of em exactly at that time
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:07 PM",Yes,i mean ahha when u buy a stock ur entitled to it u dont have to do anything. ok so if u want that then u would buy a call option on the stock
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:07 PM",Yes,"but options are very variable. they depend on the beta of the company, whcih can affect how much u pay upfornt for the option"
+12062805027,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:09 PM",No,It cost more to do options?
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:09 PM",Yes,it would be highly unadvisable to place a call or put option on say netflix which is highly volatile
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:09 PM",Yes,it depends on the beta of the company
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:09 PM",Yes,beta = how volatile the stock is
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:09 PM",Yes,higher beta higher cost
+12062805027,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:09 PM",No,Volatile?
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:09 PM",Yes,how much the stock fluctuates
+12062805027,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:11 PM",No,"So lets say I'm planning to invest in amd, I want 75 shares when it hit 4$. What options would I use?"
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:11 PM",Yes,haha well AMD is worth more than $4 now. i would put a call option on the stock 
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:11 PM",Yes,so right now AMD is like $4.6 u put a call option for the stock at $8
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:11 PM",Yes,that would be an exmaple
+12062805027,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:11 PM",No,I thought call was to sell your stock
+12062805027,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:13 PM",No,I'm looking to buy it when it drops down to 4$
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:13 PM",Yes,oh
+12062805027,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:13 PM",No,It would be a put right? 
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:13 PM",Yes,thats a call actually. i completely messed up with what i said earlier
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:13 PM",Yes,that was a put hahahahaha
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:13 PM",Yes,so the example i said before was supposed to be a put. the one u want is a call
+12062805027,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:13 PM",No,So a call is buying 
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:13 PM",Yes,yes
+12062805027,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:13 PM",No,What would AON do in this situation?
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:16 PM",Yes,Not sure haha once again I haven't really seen AON before 
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:16 PM",Yes,But I can garuntee u most options exchanges don't do that
+12062805027,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:17 PM",No,"K, do premiums for options cost a lot more?"
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:18 PM",Yes,Depends on beta 
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:19 PM",Yes,Haha I gotta go do work stuff. I'm gonna respond slower
+12062805027,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:19 PM",No,"Ha no problem, is the beta of a company showed or not?"
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:20 PM",Yes,yea its a formula
+12064847887,"Jul 18, 2013, 9:20 PM",Yes,go on google look up a stock its all threre
+12064847887,"Jul 19, 2013, 10:59 AM",Yes,if u wanna see something cool haha check out microsoft's stock. just got raped
+12062805027,"Jul 19, 2013, 11:00 AM",No,Yeah they're earning report screwed everyone lol
+12064847887,"Jul 19, 2013, 11:01 AM",Yes,so haha AMD Is a risky buy now. It has a ton of upside still but the problem is a lot of credit rating agencies downgraded AMD and people are gonna ride momentum and prob short the stock for a bit. AMD is coming towards that point where I believe it would be a good decision to buy haha not that u should listen ot me or anything
+12064847887,"Jul 19, 2013, 11:01 AM",Yes,them and google got raped hard
+12064847887,"Jul 19, 2013, 11:01 AM",Yes,mcsft was way down after hours already haha
+12062805027,"Jul 19, 2013, 11:01 AM",No,I bought it this morning
+12062805027,"Jul 19, 2013, 11:01 AM",No,I was looking at it and was like the heck
+12064847887,"Jul 19, 2013, 11:01 AM",Yes,haha how many did u buy?
+12062805027,"Jul 19, 2013, 11:01 AM",No,I have 80 shares of it atm
+12064847887,"Jul 19, 2013, 11:01 AM",Yes,how much was the transaction fee?
+12062805027,"Jul 19, 2013, 11:05 AM",No,Lol I got someone to open a account so my first 3 trans are free haha
+12064847887,"Jul 19, 2013, 11:05 AM",Yes,oh nice haha
+12064847887,"Jul 19, 2013, 11:05 AM",Yes,thats good then
+12064847887,"Jul 19, 2013, 11:05 AM",Yes,"haha but once again not sure how the market is going to react. I read that the credit rating agencies see high upside in AMD cuz of the gaming market, which i agree with, but until the consoles come out im unsure how bad the company will get raped int he time being"
+12064847887,"Jul 19, 2013, 11:05 AM",Yes,in general tech has not been doing well in the past few months
+12062805027,"Jul 19, 2013, 11:08 AM",No,It's been consistent since I first bought it a couple months ago. Until today I havnt seen any real bad drops
+12064847887,"Sep 11, 2013, 3:05 PM",Yes,Oh my god....LOL AMD GOT BOUGHT
+12062805027,"Sep 11, 2013, 3:04 PM",No,Wait really? By who?
+12064847887,"Sep 11, 2013, 3:06 PM",Yes,Oh oops nvm read it wrong but AMD is out of the s&p 500
+12064847887,"Sep 11, 2013, 3:07 PM",Yes,Which is very very bad
+12062805027,"Sep 11, 2013, 3:06 PM",No,Yeah I saw that lol
+12062805027,"Sep 11, 2013, 3:08 PM",No,What's the midcap 400?
+12064847887,"Sep 11, 2013, 3:10 PM",Yes,Haha tbh no clue
+12062805027,"Sep 11, 2013, 3:11 PM",No,It got put into the s&p midcap 400
+12062805027,"Sep 11, 2013, 3:15 PM",No,It got switched by some pharmaceutical company stating that amd isn't a big business lol
+12062805027,"Sep 11, 2013, 3:15 PM",No,Tf?
+12064847887,"Sep 11, 2013, 3:34 PM",Yes,yeah i saw that. its tough to say. AMD has a lot of potential to grow now but i mean there is a lot of risk involved. AMD has a lot of negative momentum and it could stay that way for a while. if i were u i would be pretty stuck in a bind as to what to do haha
+12062805027,"Sep 11, 2013, 3:34 PM",No,I'm just gonna hold it out haha. It should drop but not too much cause they're making good steps toward graphics wise
+12062805027,"Sep 11, 2013, 3:34 PM",No,The change might drop a lil tho
+12064847887,"Sep 14, 2013, 10:06 AM",Yes,Yeah that makes sense I think the same too. 
+12062805027,"Sep 16, 2013, 8:15 AM",No,Dang everything went up today haha. Ready for gta5?
+12062805027,"Sep 29, 2013, 3:06 PM",No,Jake locker carted off field 
+12064847887,"Sep 29, 2013, 3:38 PM",Yes,T_T.

+12066177563,"Oct 18, 2012, 8:31 PM",No,oh
+12066177563,"Oct 18, 2012, 8:31 PM",No,well he did better than i expected

+12064847887,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:39 AM",Yes,That penalty at the end was bs too
+12069924635,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:39 AM",No,Yeah it was stupid
+12066177563,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:39 AM",No,You just saw it?
+12064847887,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:39 AM",Yes,I saw highlights. I only saw the first half live
+12066177563,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:40 AM",No,Ohhh. If we didn't drop all those passes we would've won easy. And I don't know how we let gore get passed so much
+12064847887,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:41 AM",Yes,Seahawks need to revamp their receiving core in general. Not just tho game but past few have had terrible dropped passes and receivers have a tough time getting open
+12069924635,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:42 AM",No,On the brightside hopefully gore got injured 
+12066177563,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:42 AM",No,They say gore is fine 
+12069924635,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:42 AM",No,Our receivers are too small and too slow
+12066177563,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:42 AM",No,Ya out receivers are terrible
+12069924635,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:42 AM",No,Nawww

+12064847887,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:43 AM",Yes,Sidney rice isn't as good as he used to be though
+12066177563,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:42 AM",No,Doug Baldwin got pulled out in the first quarter. Could've been another reason we lost 
+12069924635,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:46 AM",No,We don't have any real nfl level WR
+12064847887,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:46 AM",Yes,They better draft one. 
+12066177563,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:46 AM",No,Even lynch dropped that 3rd down pass :(
+12064847887,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:47 AM",Yes,Marqise lee. Pete Carroll better get him considering he is from USC
+14259431562,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:46 AM",No,Yes
+12066177563,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:46 AM",No,Can't rely on rookies man
+12069924635,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:46 AM",No,Yeah they should. It's really our biggest issue now
+12069924635,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:46 AM",No,That guy is good too
+14259431562,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:46 AM",No,I'm not sure we can get him tho well be higher up in draft this year 
+12064847887,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:48 AM",Yes,Marquise lee has incredible upside
+12069924635,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:46 AM",No,But yeah WR are a bust to often 
+12066177563,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:46 AM",No,We need kasen Williams oh baby
+12064847887,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:48 AM",Yes,Ehhh not a big fan of kasen
+12064847887,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:49 AM",Yes,Well ok after the Stanford game. I've started to change my mind though 
+12066177563,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:49 AM",No,He's a monster 
+14259431562,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:49 AM",No,I think we need a TE too
+12064847887,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:49 AM",Yes,He doesn't get open. That's what frustrates me. 
+12064847887,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:49 AM",Yes,Seahawks have good blocking te. Just not receiving
+12064847887,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:49 AM",Yes,Kasen after te catch though. Oh boy. That guy does not go down
+12066177563,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:49 AM",No,Russel Wilson is impressing me tho
+14259431562,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:49 AM",No,yep McCoy miller and that other guy are so slow....
+12069924635,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:51 AM",No,We need Austin Sepharian-Jenkins
+12064847887,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:51 AM",Yes,^beast
+12064847887,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:51 AM",Yes,Love that guy

+12064847887,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:52 AM",Yes,He has LOLO in his name. 
+12069924635,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:51 AM",No,Best player on UW football
+12069924635,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:53 AM",No,Oh god that guy is huge 
+12064847887,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:53 AM",Yes,Yeah. I'm a huge fan of Keith price but Austin sefarian is the best guy on the team
+12064847887,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:53 AM",Yes,If Keith price got recruited to Oregon instead of Washington though....imagine how good Oregon would be
+12064847887,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:53 AM",Yes,He almost went to Oregon
+12069924635,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:53 AM",No,Yeah you spelled it right. Toilolo I think 
+14259431562,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:53 AM",No,Watch him play in gig harbor in hs on YouTube he literally dwarfs the whole team
+12064847887,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:54 AM",Yes,The Bellevue high school offensive lineman got drafted to the steelers this year
+12064847887,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:54 AM",Yes,Toilolo is good but not as good as fleener in my opinion anyways. 
+12066177563,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:59 AM",No,Anyway I might have a chance to beat Kevin Zhao now 
+12066177563,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:59 AM",No,I'm praying to the ff gods
+12069924635,"Oct 19, 2012, 9:59 AM",No,I hope gore falls of a bus

+12066177563,"Oct 19, 2012, 10:00 AM",No,Lol have some class man
+14259431562,"Oct 19, 2012, 10:00 AM",No,It's interesting how in the nfl draft teams tend draft for need while in baseball they usually draft based off talent only regardless of position until like later rounds...
+12066177563,"Oct 19, 2012, 10:01 AM",No,Interesting
+12064847887,"Oct 19, 2012, 10:01 AM",Yes,Unless its a qb. 
+12069924635,"Oct 19, 2012, 10:01 AM",No,Cool wilburt

+12066177563,"Oct 19, 2012, 10:01 AM",No,LOL a fucking fast hard hitting monkey
+12066177563,"Oct 19, 2012, 10:02 AM",No,I think lynch is a better rb than gore tho
+12069924635,"Oct 19, 2012, 10:02 AM",No,Is that racist? I think so
+12064847887,"Oct 19, 2012, 10:02 AM",Yes,Yeah lynch is
+14259431562,"Oct 19, 2012, 10:02 AM",No,but I guess that's cause in football top picks go straight to the team which you can't actually do in baseball so it's weird whenever I see people wanting college players right away lol
+12064847887,"Oct 19, 2012, 10:03 AM",Yes,"Rookie qbs have been doing rally well lately though. Like Andy dalton, rg3, newton *except this season"
+12066177563,"Oct 19, 2012, 10:03 AM",No,Did anyone else think that very last play yesterday was enough for a first down??
+12064847887,"Oct 19, 2012, 10:04 AM",Yes,The ball spot I thought was wrong but idk it was too close to tell. They didn't give him enough forward progress
+12066177563,"Oct 19, 2012, 10:04 AM",No,So gay
+14259431562,"Oct 19, 2012, 10:04 AM",No,Well there was the penalty

+12064847887,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:18 PM",Yes,and im not upgrading to windows 8 but i do get a free license. sim city 4 is really hard u have to get all the tax rates right
+12064847887,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:18 PM",Yes,in order for ur city to work
+14257365590,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:18 PM",No,Mm why aren't you updating?
+12064847887,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:20 PM",Yes,and making sure commute times stay short is almost impossible....in big cities. i dont trust windows until they get at least service pack 1
+14257365590,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:20 PM",No,Lololol so cautious
+12064847887,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:20 PM",Yes,after vista...never again

+14257365590,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:20 PM",No,Hmm I don't think it will flop as hard as vista. I hope
+12064847887,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:20 PM",Yes,i would want 8 if i had a tablet or somehting
+12064847887,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:20 PM",Yes,windows 8 has really good reviews so far

+14259431562,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:22 PM",No,normal one seems like like iPad ripoff with no apps
+12064847887,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:22 PM",Yes,the surface commercial is so annoying
+14257365590,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:23 PM",No,"Lol I haven't seen any commercials, but I want one"

+12064847887,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:24 PM",Yes,haha yeah u told me. its so corny....windows 8 is purely based around the tablet i think 
+14257365590,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:24 PM",No,Probably
+12069924635,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:24 PM",No,Yeah from what I've heard it's stupid for PCs
+12064847887,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:24 PM",Yes,i honestly prefer not having all the flashy stuff though cuz it just takes ram usage. i like 7 cuz its simplistic. 
+12064847887,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:25 PM",Yes,but i might get it for my mac cuz this guy next door to me has it on his mac and it works pretty well with the multitouch
+14259431562,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:25 PM",No,Maybe but I found 7 not that fast still compared to do
+14259431562,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:25 PM",No,Xp I mean
+12064847887,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:25 PM",Yes,XP doesnt support 64 bit htough

+12064847887,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:26 PM",Yes,well the only difference is just the amount of ram it uses?
+14259431562,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:26 PM",No,It was incompatible with all my stuff so I switched back to 32
+12064847887,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:26 PM",Yes,oh haha yeah i guess thats kind of a problem. it messed up one of my games
+14259431562,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:26 PM",No,Programs have to be written for 64 bit tho
+12064847887,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:26 PM",Yes,i didnt raelly have that big of a problem other than one of my games but i just limited the amount of ram it could use. compatibility didnt even work for me
+12064847887,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:27 PM",Yes,and 4gb ram honestly is just outdated now. windows 8 has really good boot times too. almost as fast as mac os x
+14257365590,"Oct 30, 2012, 8:28 PM",No,"I dunno, I figure it might be annoying to learn it but it'll be worth the switch later"

+14257365590,"Nov 5, 2012, 4:14 PM",No,"You should. Vote for Obama, Romney is going to take away our coverage by our parents health insurances"

+14257365590,"Nov 5, 2012, 5:36 PM",No,"Sigh. Well none of you guys are in swing states, it won't make a huge difference"
+12064847887,"Nov 5, 2012, 5:39 PM",Yes,It's not like Washington is gonna be republican this year haha
+14257365590,"Nov 5, 2012, 5:40 PM",No,Western Washington always squashes eastern Washington in everything
+12064847887,"Nov 5, 2012, 5:42 PM",Yes,I don't think Romney is that bad of a presidential candidate though. He's a more moderate republican in some senses. I am pretty liberal though so no way am I voting for him either way lol

+12069924635,"Nov 5, 2012, 6:12 PM",No,I just think believing in Mormons makes you somewhat of a moron 
+14257365590,"Nov 5, 2012, 6:12 PM",No,"I feel that way about a lot of beliefs, Mormonism isn't any worse/different, it's just as crazy"
+12069924635,"Nov 5, 2012, 6:16 PM",No,Mormons just seem extra crazy. I am extremely biased and closed minded though
+14257365590,"Nov 5, 2012, 6:19 PM",No,"Haha. Mormons believe in a man who said he saw a message from god, but he can't show it to anyone else. Christians believe in a bible written hundreds of years after Christ. Muslims believe in jihad even in the modern era"

+14259431562,"Nov 7, 2012, 1:32 PM",No,"I was thinking more along the lines of Big Three as in mariners super pitching prospects taijuan walker, Danny hultzen and James Paxton "
+14257365590,"Nov 7, 2012, 2:06 PM",No,"Or the big three as Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic back in the days"
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 2:19 PM",No,"LBJ, D-Wade, and Chris Bosh "
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 2:53 PM",No,Holy shit Linsen. Your team has the greatest fuming matchups ever

+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 2:59 PM",No,"Loc. I'll probably lose though, I have to start Vick "
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 2:59 PM",No,want dalton?
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:00 PM",No,Naw I'll take Vick. Even if he does poorly throwing wise. He makes up for it with 5 or so points worth of rushing 
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:00 PM",No,and loses that with all his fumbles lOL
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:00 PM",No,i'm guessing the upset bengals beat giants
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:00 PM",No,thats just me tho
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:01 PM",No,i'm also the only one guessing bears win
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:01 PM",No,He hasn't fumbled in a while. 
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:01 PM",No,The bears winning is a reasonable choice. 
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:01 PM",No,Bengals I can't follow though. 
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:02 PM",No,"ya, i think the bears are better, personally"
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:02 PM",No,"eh, bengals are pretty underrated imo"
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:02 PM",No,Weaker at QB though. 
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:02 PM",No,"matt shaube isn't great, i think jay cutler is better"
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:02 PM",No,I just don't like the bears. Their team colors are ugly 
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:02 PM",No,especially paired up with brandon marshall
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:02 PM",No,LOL
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:02 PM",No,falcons black uniforms so sexy
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:04 PM",No,I'm a huge Brandon Marshall fan. I think if he was drafted by a better team and if he got his dick out of his mouth sooner he could have been a Calvin Johnson 
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:04 PM",No,ya he makes some pretty crazy fucking catches
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:04 PM",No,"i think him and aj green, definetely 2 best receivers in the league right now"
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:04 PM",No,Matt Schaube is way more accurate than cutler. Cutler is very interception prone. Schaube will perform better against a tough defense 
+14259431562,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:04 PM",No,have you ever noticed how insanely tall green and Marshall are 
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:04 PM",No,That's why they're so good. Just like Calvin Johnson. 
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:06 PM",No,calvin johnson has had so many easy drops....
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:06 PM",No,i mean i bet he's stil good
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:06 PM",No,but that kinda makes me doubt hi
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:06 PM",No,him*
+14259431562,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:06 PM",No,Lol Schaub is a system quarterback like Alex smith so it's so they really don't have to do that much 
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:06 PM",No,"Although is LeBron had taken the scholarship from duke, we could've had a 6'8"" WR or TE in the NFL"
+14259431562,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:06 PM",No,He played football?
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:06 PM",No,*if
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:06 PM",No,anyone tall can play football
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:06 PM",No,Yeah Burt is right. 
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:06 PM",No,there isn't as much skill involved........
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:06 PM",No,basketball you gotta practice shots all day
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:08 PM",No,Yup he was a top prospect put of St Vincent-Mary High School
+14259431562,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:08 PM",No,True but I mean look at gronk and Graham's flexibility and hands it's surprisingly nimble and quick
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:08 PM",No,And LeBron is faster than both of them. He's just a physical monster
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:08 PM",No,He could out dunk jimmy graham on the cross bars LOL
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:08 PM",No,he isn't big enough to block is he
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:08 PM",No,he's pretty skinny i think
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:08 PM",No,?
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:10 PM",No,"LeBron is 6'8"" 255lbs"
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:10 PM",No,I don't think size is an issue 
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:10 PM",No,all tight ends are pretty like....bulky...
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:10 PM",No,cause you have to be able to block pretty big guys
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:10 PM",No,He's got more muscle on him than Calvin Johnson. 
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:14 PM",No,Well graham went from average height in basketball to a giant in football 
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:15 PM",No,Yeah we do. 
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:15 PM",No,Then they saw the light and realized their mistake 
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:30 PM",No,Baseball is dumb and boring
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 3:52 PM",No,
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 6:14 PM",No,Just finished pooping. I feel great 
+14259431562,"Nov 7, 2012, 8:03 PM",No,Man i have just begun to poop
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 8:03 PM",No,Awesome
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 8:18 PM",No,Dude nice 
+14257365590,"Nov 7, 2012, 9:15 PM",No,Just saw my suitemate on the toilet brushing his teeth
+14257365590,"Nov 7, 2012, 9:15 PM",No,Pooping at the same time
+14257365590,"Nov 7, 2012, 9:15 PM",No,Efficient
+14259431562,"Nov 7, 2012, 9:17 PM",No,How do you spit it out tho you'd have to get up unless you can finish in under two minutes 
+14257365590,"Nov 7, 2012, 9:19 PM",No,Apparently he did
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 10:51 PM",No,Dude Russell Wilson leads all rookies in TDs. He's so fucking legit. I'm actually excited to watch the Seahawks again. 
+14259431562,"Nov 7, 2012, 10:53 PM",No,exactly russel wilson is the man...and any arguments that he can't get yards is all cause of pete caroll holding him back...else i think he could easily get 300+yards even with lynch taking like 15 carries
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 10:53 PM",No,It's really impressive he can play this well even with Lynch taking 20+ carries a game
+14259431562,"Nov 7, 2012, 10:56 PM",No,its funny how the oldest rookie QB this year is also the worst one haha
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 11:14 PM",No,Who is it? Weeden?
+14259431562,"Nov 7, 2012, 11:15 PM",No,i can't believe weeden is 29....
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 11:15 PM",No,LOL WHAT? I had no idea. He's fucking terrible lol 
+14259431562,"Nov 7, 2012, 11:16 PM",No,he played pro ball until going back to college a couple years ago lolol
+14259431562,"Nov 7, 2012, 11:16 PM",No,pro basbeall
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 11:27 PM",No,no
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 11:27 PM",No,they need to keep giving the ball to lynch
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 11:28 PM",No,i'm not saying that just cause he's on my team
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 11:28 PM",No,gives wilson more time and makes passing game easier
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 11:36 PM",No,That's true. We don't need him to throw too much. But should the worst happen and lynch go down. While Turbin is pretty good. Russell would be able to shoulder the load and become a pass heavy QB. He is also a great mobile QB even though he doesn't get the yards 
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 11:37 PM",No,he's hella mobile
+12066177563,"Nov 7, 2012, 11:37 PM",No,scrambles like a pro
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 11:40 PM",No,"He is pro, bro "
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 11:40 PM",No,Hehe rhyme

+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 11:41 PM",No,
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 11:41 PM",No,I'm taller than this guy
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 11:41 PM",No,WTF
+14259431562,"Nov 7, 2012, 11:46 PM",No,I'm as tall as the trindon Holliday the punt returner on the broncos...but he has a 4.29 40
+12069924635,"Nov 7, 2012, 11:55 PM",No,Lol dude that guy is fast holy shit

+12066177563,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:33 PM",No,no hype
+14257365590,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:35 PM",No,"Probably cause of rg3, Doug Martin, and Andrew luck"
+14257365590,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:35 PM",No,All have more hype
+12066177563,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:35 PM",No,russel wilson has more td passes than rg3 and luck
+14257365590,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:35 PM",No,I think
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:35 PM",Yes,beyond ridiculous....andrew luck has had a mediocre season at best. 
+12066177563,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:35 PM",No,and a higher qb rating than luck
+14257365590,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:35 PM",No,But russel Wilson wasn't number 1 pick
+12066177563,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:35 PM",No,he's doing way better than luck tho
+12066177563,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:35 PM",No,all luck has is hype
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:35 PM",Yes,yeah but that shouldn't matter. just shows how broken the awards are.
+14257365590,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:35 PM",No,"This is just my speculation, and isn't these awards about hype?"
+12066177563,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:35 PM",No,ya
+12066177563,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:35 PM",No,pretty much
+12066177563,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:35 PM",No,they just give it to who the most people want to win
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:35 PM",Yes,no they have a set of professional voters
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:35 PM",Yes,its not based on hype
+12066177563,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:37 PM",No,they say that about everything
+12066177563,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:37 PM",No,lol
+12066177563,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:37 PM",No,awards are all biased
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:37 PM",Yes,its like the heisman voting system. 
+14257365590,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:37 PM",No,Plus I doubt a lot of people outside of Washington know russel Wilson
+12069924635,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:37 PM",No,Andrew luck is overrated 
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:37 PM",Yes,its teh same thing. its not really that biased....
+14257365590,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:37 PM",No,As compared to the others
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:37 PM",Yes,then again idk the only rookie of the year conversation is led by the media
+12066177563,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:37 PM",No,i think rg3 is better than russel still
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:40 PM",Yes,yea i think so too
+12066177563,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:40 PM",No,but if the seahawks get farther than the redskins
+12066177563,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:40 PM",No,which they will
+12066177563,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:40 PM",No,then russel deserves it more
+14257365590,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:40 PM",No,"Plus luck really turned the colts around from last season, they're 9-6 as opposed to 3-13 it was last season I think"
+12069924635,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:41 PM",No,It's not all luck 
+14257365590,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:41 PM",No,"Seahawks have been good this year, but not such a drastic change"
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:41 PM",Yes,yeah but its not just luck. 
+12069924635,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:41 PM",No,That guy is a turnover machine 
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:41 PM",Yes,haha yeah....seriously.
+14257365590,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:41 PM",No,"Of course it isn't, but he gets a lot of credit as a rookie qb"
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:41 PM",Yes,but at the same time that one gameÊÊagainst detroit
+12066177563,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:41 PM",No,its his fault they were behind
+12066177563,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:41 PM",No,all people look at is the comeback
+12066177563,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:41 PM",No,didn't he throw 3 picks before that
+12069924635,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:41 PM",No,RG3 has 4 interceptions

+12066177563,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:43 PM",No,it'll be fun to watch
+12064847887,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:43 PM",Yes,but he gets so many attempts.....
+12066177563,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:43 PM",No,colts have had a generously easy schedule too
+12066177563,"Dec 15, 2012, 7:43 PM",No,second probably to the falcons lol

+14257365590,"Dec 28, 2012, 8:41 PM",No,"That's all due to like 3 games that I scored way above average, then followed by multitudes of very close games that I lost"
+12069924635,"Dec 28, 2012, 8:50 PM",No,The proof is in the pudding David. Two years in a row is no fluke 
+14257365590,"Dec 28, 2012, 9:00 PM",No,"The first year is a fluke by default considering I did not draft, and it was my first year"
+14257365590,"Dec 28, 2012, 9:00 PM",No,Second year is unlucky
+14257365590,"Dec 28, 2012, 9:00 PM",No,Third time's the charm

+12069924635,"Dec 28, 2012, 9:02 PM",No,I can see it happening 
+14257365590,"Dec 28, 2012, 9:02 PM",No,"Considering it will be our keeper league, even more of a reason to do well"

+12064847887,"Dec 30, 2012, 9:58 PM",Yes,i wouldnt be worried about the redskins i would be worried about the teams after the redskins lol

+12069924635,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:24 PM",No,Peyton had his time. Matty Ice all the way 
+12064847887,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:24 PM",Yes,peyton is better than matt ryan. sorry :)
+12066177563,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:24 PM",No,My favorite hits are still Tate's hit on Sean lee and browners hit on Wes weaker 
+12064847887,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:26 PM",Yes,best hit of 2012 is sean parker on marcus wheaton from uw
+12064847887,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:26 PM",Yes,*on osu

+12069924635,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:26 PM",No,Peyton is old. No one cares anymore. Tom Brady is a douche. Matty Ice ftw
+12064847887,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:26 PM",Yes,uw osu game was amazing. missed out. everyone cares about peyton 
+12069924635,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:26 PM",No,Peyton is old news
+12064847887,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:26 PM",Yes,peyton is only 36 though
+12066177563,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:26 PM",No,Roddy and Julio are more important than Matt Ryan. Any qb can throw to those 2
+12064847887,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:27 PM",Yes,he easily has two more years on him 
+12064847887,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:27 PM",Yes,judging by the way hes been playing
+12069924635,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:28 PM",No,Did you just say Matt Ryan is unimportant? 
+12064847887,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:28 PM",Yes,ya matt ryan has a good supporting cast too 
+12069924635,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:28 PM",No,Linsen you're a fucking idiot 
+12069924635,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:28 PM",No,Not even a falcons fan
+12066177563,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:28 PM",No,He's way more replaceable than those 2 lol
+12064847887,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:28 PM",Yes,well he said more important lol
+12064847887,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:28 PM",Yes,buttttt idk about replaceable 
+12069924635,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:28 PM",No,You don't seem to understand the term franchise quarterback 
+12069924635,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:28 PM",No,WR can't make plays if the ball doesn't get to them......
+12064847887,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:28 PM",Yes,i question whether this season for matt ryan was a fluke season or if hes getting better though. i mean like 2-3 years ago no one really considered him a top 5 qb
+12066177563,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:30 PM",No,Matt Ryan is good. But him being good has more to do with his wr core. At least that's just what I think
+12069924635,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:30 PM",No,They play off one and another. But in the end. The ball is always in the QB hand 
+12066177563,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:30 PM",No,You throw Julio and roddy onto any team and they instantly score
+12066177563,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:30 PM",No,You throw Matt Ryan on a team with shitty wr and it's poop
+12064847887,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:30 PM",Yes,well its not like roddy white just got on the team either. hes been there for a while. 
+12069924635,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:30 PM",No,Take Russell Wilson for example. Sidney Rice and Golden Tate were next to useless until they had someone competent throwing to them 
+12064847887,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:30 PM",Yes,and matt ryan wasnt like the best back then. 
+12064847887,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:30 PM",Yes,well no haha tate was good with hasselbeck for a season and rice was amazing
+12064847887,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:32 PM",Yes,on the vikings
+12064847887,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:32 PM",Yes,with brett 
+12069924635,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:32 PM",No,That's Brett Favre though. 
+12064847887,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:32 PM",Yes,but now. rice isnt that great anymore with his injury issues so yeah ill say wilson has a big impact
+12069924635,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:32 PM",No,It's not like we've ever seen anyone but Ryan throw to Julio jones anyways. 
+12069924635,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:32 PM",No,Although admittedly Roddy has always been at least decent. 
+12066177563,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:32 PM",No,Don't forget tony g
+12069924635,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:34 PM",No,"Look at Larry Fitzgerald. I'm sure most wouldn't consider Kevin kolb irreplaceable, but now look. He's a god compared to his backups"
+12064847887,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:35 PM",Yes,larry fitzgerald almost came to seattle 
+12069924635,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:35 PM",No,And Larry can't do shit cause some half brained retard is chucking the ball to the defenders
+12069924635,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:35 PM",No,I wish he did 
+12064847887,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:35 PM",Yes,i was listening to kjr once and his dad went on the radio and complained about the cardinals qb issues lololol and wanted him to go to the seahawks
+12069924635,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:36 PM",No,He should have. Him and russel could have done great things 
+12064847887,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:36 PM",Yes,this was 3 years ago haha
+12066177563,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:36 PM",No,Man playoffs can't come soon enough
+12069924635,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:37 PM",No,That is assuming Larry would still be here. 
+12066177563,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:37 PM",No,i guess its about time i added up picks...
+12064847887,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:38 PM",Yes,haha
+12069924635,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:38 PM",No,Yes it is 
+12066177563,"Dec 30, 2012, 10:53 PM",No,fuck finally done

+14257365590,"Dec 30, 2012, 11:32 PM",No,Well you should wait until the post season is also over

+12066177563,"Jan 11, 2013, 11:14 AM",No,I still need to see Argo 
+14259431562,"Jan 11, 2013, 11:15 AM",No,I still want to see it...but I hate all the love for the small films no one cares about that are just emotional movies...
+12069924635,"Jan 11, 2013, 11:16 AM",No,That looked sort of boring 
+12066177563,"Jan 11, 2013, 11:17 AM",No,Ya like last years black and white silent film
+12066177563,"Jan 11, 2013, 11:17 AM",No,Argo is about the Iranian hostage situation how is that boring
+12069924635,"Jan 11, 2013, 11:18 AM",No,Not directed by Quentin terentino
+12064847887,"Jan 11, 2013, 11:18 AM",Yes,Lol Argo looks good man
+12066177563,"Jan 11, 2013, 11:18 AM",No,Ben affleck is so talented
+14259431562,"Jan 11, 2013, 11:18 AM",No,Lol Ben affleck has good tone to his film like in town and Argo
+14259431562,"Jan 11, 2013, 11:20 AM",No,it's like Christopher Nolanesque only more contemporary
+12066177563,"Jan 11, 2013, 11:20 AM",No,Naw. Ben affleck is very straightforward. What I like about Christopher Nolan is his creativity
+12064847887,"Jan 11, 2013, 11:22 AM",Yes,sadly gonna have to agree with Linsen. 
+14259431562,"Jan 11, 2013, 11:22 AM",No,More straightforward but i think the tones are similar
+12066177563,"Jan 11, 2013, 11:22 AM",No,Mmmm. I wanna see Nolan make a comedy
+14259431562,"Jan 11, 2013, 11:22 AM",No,I think affleck is gritty and realistic and the action scenes (from what I've seen at least) are similar to Nolan's...especially when affleck is also directing
+12064847887,"Jan 11, 2013, 11:24 AM",Yes,I think afflecks movies are more based on reality than Nolan's though
+14259431562,"Jan 11, 2013, 11:24 AM",No,LOL you would think it would be a comedy until it turns out to be another mind bender
+12066177563,"Jan 11, 2013, 11:24 AM",No,Ya afflecks movies are very real
+14259431562,"Jan 11, 2013, 11:24 AM",No,Have you seen insomnia? It's really similar I think to the town in feel
+12066177563,"Jan 11, 2013, 11:24 AM",No,Insomnia feels more like a mystery and suspense
+12066177563,"Jan 11, 2013, 11:24 AM",No,The town is action and kind of romance

+12064847887,"Jan 20, 2013, 6:47 PM",Yes,To be fair he seems to har gotten better. But still I don't like him
+12069924635,"Jan 20, 2013, 6:47 PM",No,You tend to make a lot of broad overarching statements that are too extreme

+12066177563,"Jan 26, 2013, 10:59 AM",No,Wow

+12066177563,"Jan 26, 2013, 3:57 PM",No,What do you guys think of trading Flynn for revis 
+12064847887,"Jan 26, 2013, 4:00 PM",Yes,Why would the jets ever do that
+12064847887,"Jan 26, 2013, 4:00 PM",Yes,Seahawks would have to trade a lot more than Flynn for Regis
+12066177563,"Jan 26, 2013, 4:04 PM",No,Idk I read an article on it
+12064847887,"Jan 26, 2013, 4:05 PM",Yes,Oh hah I think it's bogus. No way jets would follow through. Seahawks don't even need Revis. System works well. Browner and Sherman are pro bowl caliber and Jeremy lane shows promise. But Flynn should be traded now before his trading potential  continues to drop even furt her than it already has
+12064847887,"Jan 26, 2013, 4:06 PM",Yes,I read a similar article too but it's just speculation. But it was browner and Flynn for Revis
+12069924635,"Jan 26, 2013, 4:48 PM",No,I dunno man. Revis and Sherman would be devastating 
+12064847887,"Jan 26, 2013, 4:57 PM",Yes,Flynn should be traded for a draft pick so we can get a future star receiver or lineman. 
+12069924635,"Jan 26, 2013, 6:12 PM",No,Yeah we need a receiver. Or Dwayne bowee
+12066177563,"Jan 26, 2013, 6:13 PM",No,or another pass rusher
+12069924635,"Jan 26, 2013, 6:13 PM",No,Linsen you haven't moved in awhile. 
+12066177563,"Jan 26, 2013, 6:13 PM",No,been in my dorm all day
+12066177563,"Jan 26, 2013, 6:13 PM",No,"if you pay attention, i will move in the next hour to eat"
+12064847887,"Jan 26, 2013, 6:19 PM",Yes,Draft is filled with all star receivers
+12066177563,"Jan 26, 2013, 6:18 PM",No,i'm not talking to you

+12064847887,"Jan 26, 2013, 6:20 PM",Yes,Is it cuz u suck at l4d2?
+12066177563,"Jan 26, 2013, 6:20 PM",No,no 
+12066177563,"Jan 26, 2013, 6:20 PM",No,you suck
+12064847887,"Jan 26, 2013, 6:24 PM",Yes,No don't think so

+12069924635,"Jan 26, 2013, 6:50 PM",No,Linsen you moved
+12066177563,"Jan 26, 2013, 6:52 PM",No,That's right
+12069924635,"Jan 26, 2013, 6:52 PM",No,This thing is kind of creepy
+12066177563,"Jan 26, 2013, 6:52 PM",No,i like it
+12069924635,"Jan 26, 2013, 6:52 PM",No,LOL me too
+12066177563,"Jan 26, 2013, 6:52 PM",No,i never lose wilburt anymore
+14259431562,"Jan 26, 2013, 8:12 PM",No,I've noticed in football tho trades are made more for salary cap reasons so I feel like you rarely trade for equal value...but I think browner would be a much better slot corner right now imo
+12066177563,"Jan 26, 2013, 8:12 PM",No,he has spoken
+12064847887,"Jan 26, 2013, 8:12 PM",Yes,Browner is slow
+12064847887,"Jan 26, 2013, 8:13 PM",Yes,This trade is purely for talent
+12064847887,"Jan 26, 2013, 8:13 PM",Yes,For sure
+14259431562,"Jan 26, 2013, 8:13 PM",No,I dunno it's the jets
+14259431562,"Jan 26, 2013, 8:14 PM",No,And well at least he won't get burned like he usually does in deep routes 
+12064847887,"Jan 26, 2013, 8:15 PM",Yes,Slot receivers are typically less physical and faster. Flynn would be a terrible choice anyways if it was for a salary cap reason cuz his contract is quite hefty as well
+12066177563,"Jan 26, 2013, 8:17 PM",No,browner got burned by julio jones :O
+14259431562,"Jan 26, 2013, 8:17 PM",No,Wouldn't a physical corner then be a good way to stop them
+12064847887,"Jan 26, 2013, 8:18 PM",Yes,No u want a fast corner 
+12066177563,"Jan 26, 2013, 8:22 PM",No,your mom wanted my fast corner
+12064847887,"Jan 26, 2013, 8:43 PM",Yes,is lewis zhou not going to college?

+14259431562,"Jan 26, 2013, 8:44 PM",No,I hope he doesn't...cause something like that isn't gonna last forever lol
+12064847887,"Jan 26, 2013, 8:44 PM",Yes,"sounds like it mike klinge says ""Stop shitting on college diplomas. All of your friends are going to college and we're getting fucking sick of listening to"""
+14259431562,"Jan 26, 2013, 8:44 PM",No,unless he expands to other stuff

+12064847887,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:02 PM",Yes,they would still be a beast team
+14259431562,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:02 PM",No,I agree...and FYI everyone is obsessed that Kaepernick could throw 90 In high school...but Jared fisher from Newport could do that and he went undrafted so it's not something amazing when the average high school prospect is not even looked at cause they throw 90
+12064847887,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:02 PM",Yes,and their receving core has so much depth too

+12064847887,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:05 PM",Yes,and their defense who back then was also one of the best
+12064847887,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:06 PM",Yes,because my mom is better than u
+12066177563,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:07 PM",No,not possible

+14259431562,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:08 PM",No,people say all these football players could have been star baseball players just cause of their arms...but they're ignoring the fact that majority of baseball players never actually even get halfway through the minors...
+12069924635,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:08 PM",No,If you talk to him he won't stop
+14259431562,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:08 PM",No,SPEAK

+12066177563,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:10 PM",No,Why does yor mom get the 05 one 
+14259431562,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:10 PM",No,it takes the top prospects at least two years to crack the big leagues and another couple to actually become a star...if they don't wash out and become a benchwarmers

+14259431562,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:22 PM",No,No I mean he kicked out a couple Yankee outfielders for the roster spot...now the guy he replaced is playing in Japan LOL
+12064847887,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:22 PM",Yes,oh lol yea cuz hes still a good fielder 
+12064847887,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:22 PM",Yes,what if arod came back to the mariners
+12064847887,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:25 PM",Yes,like when hes towards retirement if the yankees cut him
+14259431562,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:25 PM",No,nah he's no longer a good fielder....he has one of the smallest ranges of all MLB outfielders...but when you play with the fastest center fielder in the game next to you it's alright haha
+12064847887,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:25 PM",Yes,i think he still has a good arm
+14259431562,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:25 PM",No,Arod is probably sitting out this year with surgery I think
+12069924635,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:26 PM",No,Schaub just for a first down 
+14259431562,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:27 PM",No,True ichiro has an insane arm and is still quick...but in terms of value towards the team its a bit insignificant
+12069924635,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:29 PM",No,I like how most of the patriots ducked out of the pro bowl cause they were too busy sobbing over their loss
+12064847887,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:34 PM",Yes,Ichiro still had that big hit
+12064847887,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:34 PM",Yes,In the clutch
+12069924635,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:35 PM",No,I think Linsen is playing LoL. He's in his dorm
+14259431562,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:35 PM",No,True but baseball has so many games that value is all about long term performance so he needs to be able to do that consistently...which with the mariners he never even needed to cause they always lost :P
+12064847887,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:35 PM",Yes,But that's not his fault
+14259431562,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:35 PM",No,The lack of success over the long run was tho
+12064847887,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:36 PM",Yes,Still not his fault. 
+14259431562,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:36 PM",No,and he belongs on a team with veterans not youngsters

+12064847887,"Jan 27, 2013, 6:46 PM",Yes,The best part of the pro bowl is the end because  no one does anything on the defense.

+14257365590,"Jan 31, 2013, 12:26 PM",No,Lol. Reversion was easier than 3D arrays. Partly cause I wasn't paying attention during arrays and I was awake during recursion

+12066177563,"Jan 31, 2013, 1:13 PM",No,its just not encouraged
+14259431562,"Jan 31, 2013, 1:13 PM",No,It works now? Cause I'm pretty sure it would give compiler errors back when I did it in hs...
+12066177563,"Jan 31, 2013, 1:13 PM",No,"no, == will return true if the strings are the exact same"
+12066177563,"Jan 31, 2013, 1:15 PM",No,but apparently .equals() checks the content of the strings

+14257365590,"Jan 31, 2013, 1:22 PM",No,I liked == better than .equals() because it's less typing

+14259431562,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:39 PM",No,Yep saw that too
+12064847887,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:41 PM",Yes,idk why they didnt ask woz to look over the entire movie...that wasstupid
+14259431562,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:41 PM",No,well it is a drama
+12064847887,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:43 PM",Yes,honestly but now it seems like it just idolizes steve jobs. prob makes woz look like an incoherent babling baboon too
+12064847887,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:43 PM",Yes,especially judging by who they chose to play woz too. 
+12069924635,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:43 PM",No,That movie will be dumb
+12064847887,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:45 PM",Yes,its really dissapointing it could have been so good. if they just portrayed steve jobs as not the perfect human everyone thinks he is and show both sides it would have been a much more accurate and interesting movie. like the social network with mark zuckerberg 
+12064847887,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:45 PM",Yes,except that wasnt that accurate either but it was an amazing movie
+14259431562,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:45 PM",No,Have you read the Steve jobs book 
+14257365590,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:45 PM",No,Nope. Not a big fan of Steve jobs. I think bill gates is a much better person
+14257365590,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:45 PM",No,Jobs is just a great business man
+12069924635,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:45 PM",No,I don't care about Steve jobs at all. Boring movie either way
+14259431562,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:45 PM",No,bill gates would have went no where without Paul Allen
+14259431562,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:45 PM",No,Paul Allen actually knows what to do with his money lol
+12064847887,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:48 PM",Yes,some of it. i look up to both and yea i agree that paul allen was increidbly vital to bill gates success. the thing that makes steve jobs i think that makes him great is hes a huge risk taker and has a tendency of knowing what poeple what before they want him 
+12064847887,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:48 PM",Yes,i mean sure some can argue that hes a great business man but hes a pretty darn good one at that
+14259431562,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:49 PM",No,Jobs also had that perfectionism that bill gates really really lacked
+14259431562,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:50 PM",No,Like a blue screen of death on a windows 95 introduction?
+12064847887,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:51 PM",Yes,but i mean your honestly still comparing a few of the greatest engineering/entrepreneur minds and trying to decide who was better lol 
+12069924635,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:52 PM",No,I don't know why people idolize jobs
+14257365590,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:52 PM",No,Me neither
+14259431562,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:52 PM",No,jobs isn't a pawn
+12064847887,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:52 PM",Yes,hes only created the most valuable publicly traded company in the world....
+14259431562,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:52 PM",No,bill gates is all name no substance
+12064847887,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:52 PM",Yes,which is now number 2 after tim cook took over lololol
+14257365590,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:52 PM",No,Bill gates is a huge philanthropist
+12064847887,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:52 PM",Yes,bill gates has substance come on ahha be fair
+12069924635,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:53 PM",No,I still don't care
+14259431562,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:53 PM",No,Gates doesn't use his money very well I think
+12069924635,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:53 PM",No,Gates is a good person
+12064847887,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:53 PM",Yes,bill gates has shown just as much accomplishment as jobs has had
+14257365590,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:53 PM",No,Lol wilbert. Bill gates only created the company that dominates 90+% of the computer market
+12069924635,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:53 PM",No,He uses it for better purpose than jobs
+14259431562,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:53 PM",No,bill gates created a company but jobs has actually created an idealogy
+14257365590,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:54 PM",No,I think using it for philanthropy is a great way to spend money
+12064847887,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:54 PM",Yes,and jobs created a company that only was the most valuable publicly traded company while he was CEO
+12069924635,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:54 PM",No,Who cares
+12064847887,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:54 PM",Yes,im unsure why jobs never donated
+14257365590,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:54 PM",No,An ideology based around consumerism 
+12069924635,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:54 PM",No,He seems like an asshole
+12064847887,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:54 PM",Yes,every product is created around consumerism
+12064847887,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:54 PM",Yes,thats the only way they can survice though
+14259431562,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:54 PM",No,I like looking at Paul Allen...he spends his money on charity and on the community while bill gates has such a limited focus on his philanthropy 
+14257365590,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:55 PM",No,He was quite an asshole from what I hear
+14257365590,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:55 PM",No,"No way, what do you think indie music is Chris"
+12064847887,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:55 PM",Yes,well no normal person becomes like bill gates or steve jobs. these people are abnormal
+14259431562,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:55 PM",No,bill gates wasn't any better
+12064847887,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:55 PM",Yes,for the case of technology then
+12069924635,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:55 PM",No,Jobs seemed like a dick
+14259431562,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:55 PM",No,Gates was a freaking lakeside kid
+12069924635,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:55 PM",No,And now he's dead. Which is why people care
+12064847887,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:55 PM",Yes,ill agree with indie music haha
+12064847887,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:56 PM",Yes,ill admit steve jobs gets too much credit.

+14259431562,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:56 PM",No,I wished johny Ive could take over...but it would probably collapse apple lol
+14259431562,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:57 PM",No,though you could see with the Scott forstall thing that Johnny Ive still gets the final say lol
+14257365590,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:57 PM",No,Huh. Exxon is the number one tech company in the world? Would not have expected that
+14259431562,"Jan 31, 2013, 8:57 PM",No,I cannot respect any oil company

+14259431562,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:45 PM",No,oh wait that's Russell Wilson
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:45 PM",No,LOL

+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:45 PM",No,He really is
+14259431562,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:47 PM",No,Nah the more I see of his skill set I can def see him succeeding in a Seattle like offense
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:48 PM",No,All QBs scramble when they have to
+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:48 PM",No,Matt Ryan is a pocket passer 
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:48 PM",No,Like west coast?
+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:48 PM",No,He's not very fast lol
+14259431562,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:48 PM",No,lol but some take the sack/throw the ball away right away
+14259431562,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:48 PM",No,Nah west coast is for pocket passers isn't it?
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:48 PM",No,Seattle is west coast
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:48 PM",No,Matt Ryan plays a spread offense 
+14259431562,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:48 PM",No,No they def don't run a west coast offense...I thought spread and west coast are similar
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:50 PM",No,Now Seattle runs a west coast
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:50 PM",No,Wit Russell
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:50 PM",No,Matt Hasselback was a west coast QB too
+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:50 PM",No,Matt Ryan's left tackle always let's him down
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:51 PM",No,Although it looks like Seattle is looking towards a read option
+14259431562,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:51 PM",No,I thought they were a zone read and spread
+14259431562,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:52 PM",No,although I still don't know what the 49ers run it's so weird lol
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:52 PM",No,Yeah lol
+14259431562,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:52 PM",No,eh well id trust Russell Wilson with any system lol
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:52 PM",No,Is Seattle a zone run scheme?
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:52 PM",No,Wilson can play in most systems
+14259431562,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:53 PM",No,I think with a guy like Russell they can leave the O line the way it is and upgrade the test of the team first 
+14259431562,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:53 PM",No,yeah for sure they run it a decent amount
+14259431562,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:53 PM",No,Surprisingly tho the Seahawks in the end of the season ran more option than the redskins did in the beginning when rg3 was healthy apparently...
+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:54 PM",No,Me and Chris Wu rewatched the bears game. That's my favorite Wilson game
+14259431562,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:55 PM",No,I think his falcons game was the best
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:55 PM",No,I like that game 
+14259431562,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:55 PM",No,Showed he could throw for yards not just ride marshawn
+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:56 PM",No,Russels last 2 drives against the bears was beautiful 
+14259431562,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:56 PM",No,and of course the most insane comeback ever...I heard they're asking tony g to come back tho
+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:56 PM",No,So many saved 3rd downs
+14259431562,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:56 PM",No,indeed they were
+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:56 PM",No,Of course their asking tony g to come back
+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:56 PM",No,No one wants to lose him
+14259431562,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:56 PM",No,Of course he's now improved to the point where he doesn't need third downs ;)
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:56 PM",No,Man if we could just get a real number 1 wideout 
+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:57 PM",No,"When you say ""we"" Addison I get so confused"
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:57 PM",No,I mean the falcons have 2 #1 wideouts 
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:57 PM",No,Obviously talking about Seattle 
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:57 PM",No,Cause the falcons WRs are set 
+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:57 PM",No,I read an article where a couple ppl argued jones > megatron 
+14259431562,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:57 PM",No,LOL nah no need to remember Julio jones or sharod
+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:57 PM",No,I love jones
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:57 PM",No,Maybe in time
+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:57 PM",No,Probably my favorite player
+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:57 PM",No,Besides marshawn
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:58 PM",No,MATT RYAN
+14259431562,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:58 PM",No,Markus Wheaton look him up I think the Seahawks should get him
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:58 PM",No,Megatron has a lot to prove against randy moss and Jerry rice
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:58 PM",No,Julio is just beginning 
+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:59 PM",No,I think that game against the 49ers is too disappointing for me
+14259431562,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:59 PM",No,I wonder if the Seahawks could use someone like Titus young
+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:59 PM",No,Made me lose a little bit or Marty
+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:59 PM",No,Matty
+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:59 PM",No,No 
+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 12:59 PM",No,Seahawks have too good of an ethic
+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 1:00 PM",No,To let Titus ruin it
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 1:00 PM",No,You think Pete Carroll could whip him into shape?
+14259431562,"Feb 1, 2013, 1:00 PM",No,Russell Wilson I think could make Titus young work
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 1:00 PM",No,I'd rather get Dwayne Bowe
+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 1:00 PM",No,Titus ruins his team. He's beat his own teammate up once
+14259431562,"Feb 1, 2013, 1:00 PM",No,although I'm afraid Titus young might go to the 49ers where they have plenty of vets to keep him watched and playing well
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 1:01 PM",No,Russell would kick his ass
+14259431562,"Feb 1, 2013, 1:01 PM",No,can't deny talent tho
+14259431562,"Feb 1, 2013, 1:02 PM",No,look at Vernon David he changed a lot from what I heard
+14259431562,"Feb 1, 2013, 1:02 PM",No,Davis
+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 1:02 PM",No,Moss was more talented than rice. Rice was the better player
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 1:02 PM",No,Rice is a better guy
+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 1:02 PM",No,Ya better work ethic
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 1:02 PM",No,Moss also never won a ring 
+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 1:02 PM",No,Means a lot
+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 1:02 PM",No,Moss could've been better
+14259431562,"Feb 1, 2013, 1:04 PM",No,both are too old for me to know much about lol
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 1:04 PM",No,He played with Brady and lost LOLOLOLOL

+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 1:09 PM",No,Btw that last 4th down play with the falcons did not look within 5 yards
+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 1:09 PM",No,Like tophur said
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 1:11 PM",No,THAT LIAR

+12066177563,"Feb 1, 2013, 1:15 PM",No,4th and 4 and roddy wasn't even passed the 1st down
+12069924635,"Feb 1, 2013, 1:15 PM",No,Aiya. And tony g was wide open

+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 2:01 AM",No,You watch gameplay 
+14257365590,"Feb 4, 2013, 2:02 AM",No,Could have a cool trailer. But turn out really bad
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 2:02 AM",No,Ya. That happens a lot. There's a difference between cinematic and gameplay trailers tho

+14257365590,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:06 AM",No,Not the first time. I just got unlucky that many of my star players performed their worst during playoffs
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:10 AM",No,You did have Hakeem nicks 
+14257365590,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:23 AM",No,Who was extremely useless

+14257365590,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:23 AM",No,Then there was Martin who flopped the last few games
+14257365590,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:23 AM",No,Don't even get me started on my receivers
+14257365590,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:23 AM",No,My kicker carried the team in stability
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:25 AM",No,LOL

+14257365590,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:27 AM",No,HE WAS HORRIBLE. SO GODDAMN WORTHLESS. but he was pretty equal to the rest of my receivers...
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:38 AM",No,HAHAHAHAHA 
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:42 AM",No,I think I got the best deal out of that trade
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:42 AM",No,Demarco scored all the points Larry did in the rest of the season in one game 
+14257365590,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:42 AM",No,"Well. You didn't have an rb for the longest time, so that's debatable. We both got shitty luck"
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:44 AM",No,Naw dawg. The weeks he played he never scored in single digits 
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:44 AM",No,And Larry never got to double digits 
+14257365590,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:44 AM",No,But he only played for a very short time
+14257365590,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:44 AM",No,No he did
+14257365590,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:44 AM",No,I think he got 11 once. And 12 another time
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:44 AM",No,Well I didn't have a RB all year so I was used to it 
+14257365590,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:44 AM",No,Out of like 10 weeks or so that I had him
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:44 AM",No,All on my WR and RG3
+14257365590,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:46 AM",No,WR just aren't as dependable as running backs
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:46 AM",No,"Naw dawg. Roddy white, Vincent Jackson "
+14257365590,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:46 AM",No,We need to have a league next year with two quarterbacks
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:46 AM",No,I'm doing that one 
+14257365590,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:46 AM",No,So we can break 100 regularly and feel good about ourselves
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:47 AM",No,THAT'S WHAT IM TALKIN ABOUT 
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 8:48 AM",No,NO ONE FROM THE TOP 5 IS INVITED

+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:12 AM",No,You're right 
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:12 AM",No,It's as cool as Joe Flacco winning MVP
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:39 AM",No,How are you guys up so early...
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:46 AM",No,That last throw to Crabtree was 100% pi
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:47 AM",No,But refs too scare to throw it
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:48 AM",No,Naw it was clean
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:49 AM",No,You're a dumbass
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:49 AM",No,Crabtree pushed off too. It would have cancelled out 
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:49 AM",No,That ball was uncatchable anyways 
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:49 AM",No,The guy was holding onto his jersey
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:49 AM",No,The ball was catchable it was barely out of his reach
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:49 AM",No,Because he was being held
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:49 AM",No,It was way too for out. 
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:50 AM",No,You overestimate Crabtree ability 
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:50 AM",No,I'm watching it now he would have had it with 1 or 2 more steps
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 12:52 PM",No,
+14257365590,"Feb 4, 2013, 12:53 PM",No,I think you're a large part of this
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 12:54 PM",No,What did I do?!?!??
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 12:55 PM",No,Dude no
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 12:55 PM",No,Crabtree would have had to go straight up and straight down. He would've been shoved out by then
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 12:55 PM",No,And anyways the refs sometimes just let the players play. 
+14257365590,"Feb 4, 2013, 12:56 PM",No,You encourage him linsen
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 12:56 PM",No,The 49ers beat the falcons with a questionable holding. And they blasted flacco when he was out of bounds 
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 12:57 PM",No,ya
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 12:57 PM",No,and the stupid fucking roughing the passer call

+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 1:02 PM",No,only problem with matty is his tendency to turn the ball over at the worst possible times
+14259431562,"Feb 4, 2013, 1:02 PM",No,which means matt cassell and mark sanchez are elite...
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 1:02 PM",No,matt ryan is way beter than cassell and sanchez
+14259431562,"Feb 4, 2013, 1:02 PM",No,they both have more wins that matt ryan in the playoffs LOL
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 1:02 PM",No,wtf how can you even put him anywhere near the same level as them
+14259431562,"Feb 4, 2013, 1:02 PM",No,you said all matt ryan needed to be elite was a playoff win
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 1:02 PM",No,"ya, because"
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 1:02 PM",No,the reason people said he wasn't was because he choked in the playoffs
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 1:02 PM",No,and this year showed that wasn't true
+14259431562,"Feb 4, 2013, 1:02 PM",No,he def choked tho
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 1:02 PM",No,which was the only thing standing between him and elite
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 1:02 PM",No,his defense choked
+14259431562,"Feb 4, 2013, 1:02 PM",No,he had two good halves
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 1:02 PM",No,he played well the entire game
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 1:02 PM",No,he had almost 400 passing yars on the day

+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 1:17 PM",No,"i'm watching ryan play, and he is so much trust in his receievers"
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 1:17 PM",No,he throws the ball before they even make their cuts

+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:46 PM",No,Every catch is game breaking. The refs called it the same as any other play 
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:46 PM",No,that was like the 4th down last play tho
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:46 PM",No,thats the only one people are gonna pay attention to
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:48 PM",No,Counts just as much as every throw or catch. The all hold the same value 
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:48 PM",No,not to the viewr

+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:49 PM",No,who cares about a 1st a 10 play in the 1st quarter
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:49 PM",No,where there is maybe a holding call that isn't called
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:49 PM",No,no one pays attention to that
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:49 PM",No,What if it's a no call there?
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:50 PM",No,"so, people have the rest of the game to watch"
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:50 PM",No,Same thing 
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:50 PM",No,the rest of the game to score

+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:50 PM",No,of course people are going to care about it more
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:50 PM",No,A TD in the fourth is the same 7 points scored in the first 
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:50 PM",No,except that theres 3 more quarters after the 1st
+14259431562,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:50 PM",No,Maybe Kaepernick shouldn't have thrown a ball to Ed reed
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:51 PM",No,It's so dumb. At least all the former players know that it isn't at all controversial. It was an acceptable no call
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:51 PM",No,Same point value 
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:51 PM",No,it also would've been an acceptable call
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:51 PM",No,its not the same value at that point though
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:51 PM",No,its not just 7 points
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:51 PM",No,its win or lose
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:51 PM",No,It's that mentality that the first quarter doesn't matter
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:51 PM",No,That lost the 49ers the game 
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:52 PM",No,They could've have already won if they scored in the first 
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:53 PM",No,And no one would've cared about a no call in the first 
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:53 PM",No,the game wouldn't have played
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:53 PM",No,the exact same way
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:53 PM",No,if they scored in the first
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:53 PM",No,Who's to say it wouldn't?
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:53 PM",No,no one
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:53 PM",No,but i could ask you the same quesiton the other way
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:53 PM",No,if the 49ers scored
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:53 PM",No,the ravens game plan wouldn't have been to play so safe
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:53 PM",No,they would have to go for more big plays
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:53 PM",No,the 49ers wouldn't be palying catchup
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:53 PM",No,it makes a difference
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:54 PM",No,All the ravens do is go for big plays 
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:54 PM",No,think about it like this
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:54 PM",No,if you're a ref
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:54 PM",No,and you see a possible holding call in the first quarter
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:54 PM",No,"Nothing about the ravens says ""conservative"""
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:54 PM",No,its a matter of if they get a td or not
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:55 PM",No,if you have to call the same play in the last 15 seconds
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:55 PM",No,its literally who wins the superbowl at that point
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:55 PM",No,of course its a much bigger decision
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:55 PM",No,and of course it'll be more controversial
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:55 PM",No,That's a bad way to think about it
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:55 PM",No,In the fourth I'd be more likely to throw it 
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:55 PM",No,well
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:55 PM",No,But I call PI on every play 
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:55 PM",No,you aren't a ref
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:55 PM",No,Neither are you 
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:55 PM",No,you asked why people are calling it controversial
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:55 PM",No,i'm telling you why
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:55 PM",No,They're professionals and I have no choice but to agree wit them
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:55 PM",No,What about the late hit on flacco?
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:56 PM",No,The no call in Atlanta?
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:57 PM",No,those are controversial
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:57 PM",No,people are still talking about that 
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:57 PM",No,I don't hear anything 
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:57 PM",No,because they aren't as big as this one
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:57 PM",No,because
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:57 PM",No,And I'm very tuned in
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:57 PM",No,this decided everything
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:57 PM",No,Maybe the Kaepernick pick decided the game 
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:57 PM",No,The James fumble 
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:57 PM",No,theres was still time in the game at that point
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:57 PM",No,The rice fumble 
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:57 PM",No,what don't you understand about that
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:57 PM",No,when it came down to that call
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:57 PM",No,it was literally
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:57 PM",No,do i give the game to the ravens or the 49ers
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:57 PM",No,There was time left 
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:57 PM",No,"ya, for the ravens to have to score a td"
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:57 PM",No,or 
+12066177563,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:59 PM",No,for them to just have to get a 1st down
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:59 PM",No, That's just how the game goes. Like the power outage 
+12069924635,"Feb 4, 2013, 11:59 PM",No,Like WTF 
+12069924635,"Feb 5, 2013, 12:00 AM",No,I still think it's just butthurt fans being butthurt

+12066177563,"Feb 5, 2013, 12:02 AM",No,controversy is whatever people make it out to be
+12066177563,"Feb 5, 2013, 12:03 AM",No,big deals are what make controversies
+12069924635,"Feb 5, 2013, 12:04 AM",No,It would've been a good call either way
+12066177563,"Feb 5, 2013, 12:04 AM",No,which is why its controversial......
+12069924635,"Feb 5, 2013, 12:04 AM",No,Maybe controversial is a bad choice of words 
+12069924635,"Feb 5, 2013, 12:04 AM",No,It was a good call/non call

+14257365590,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:12 PM",No,Lol I dunno if it would actually be popular though. It would be expensive and I can't imagine it having such a large functionality besides not having to take your phone out to see a notification...

+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:28 PM",No,I just read the most bullshit list of top 65 qbs in the league right now
+14257365590,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:30 PM",No,Btw the pope just resigned
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:30 PM",No,nah i'd say spring training rapes preseason football everytime
+12069924635,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:30 PM",No,I'd rather read about draft picks than read about RBI and whatnot
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:30 PM",No,but regular seasons are about equal especially since baseball is more frequent
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:30 PM",No,yeah its a good thing for the pope
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:30 PM",No,at least then they won't leave in medically impaired guys forver now to make things awkward lolol
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:30 PM",No,addy do you have any idea of qbs the seahawks or falcons should draft as a backup
+12069924635,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:30 PM",No,Nope
+12069924635,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:30 PM",No,I only those who are projected for like 1st or second round 
+12069924635,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:30 PM",No,I know who the falcons should draft as DE and TE 
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:30 PM",No,who for TE
+12069924635,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:33 PM",No,Zach Ertz
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:33 PM",No,You don't think they shoul draft a rb?
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:33 PM",No,mehhh if tony gonzalez leaves that would be a mediocre choice
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:33 PM",No,isn't ertz suppose to be a blocking TE mainly
+12069924635,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:34 PM",No,Defensive first. Worry about offense later 
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:37 PM",No,falcons should trade for mark sanchez and then release matt ryan and trade away julio jones and roddy white for tim tebow 
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:37 PM",No,Wilburt so smart
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:38 PM",No,instant super bowl right there

+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:39 PM",No,man i hate how blatantly biased BR stuff always is...
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:39 PM",No,They have people who are biased for every team tho so it's interesting 
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:40 PM",No,Matt Ryan at 4 is very gg tho
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:41 PM",No,poor ryan lindley LOL
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:41 PM",Yes,Ertz is a great receiver
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:41 PM",No,Matt Schaub is wayyyyyy too high
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:42 PM",Yes,Matt Ryan at 4....ur joking.....
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:42 PM",No,Ya he should be higher
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:43 PM",Yes,Ohhhh this is reg season. Nah he's right where he should be IMO
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:44 PM",No,i thought i read somewhere that ertz was a mainly blocking TE
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:44 PM",No,If you look at his stats he played really well in the playoffs. Besides his fumble he did pretty much everything right
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:45 PM",Yes,Everyone above him was better this season I think. Ertz can def catch the ball very well
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:45 PM",No,broncos had an even easier regular season schedule than the falcons...
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:45 PM",No,and they lost their first playoff game
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:47 PM",No,lol did you see that broncos next year have the easisest schedule
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:47 PM",No,they're gonna need it
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:47 PM",No,they're overrated
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:47 PM",No,"i thought they were amazing, and they proved me wrong"
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:48 PM",No,LOL this list is funny...must be awkward having a teams third string qb be better than all of some other teams starters
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:49 PM",No,do you think its accurate tho
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:50 PM",No,i dunno im only halfway there...but it has locker worse than hassellbeck?!
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:50 PM",Yes,Hasselbeck is def better
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:50 PM",Yes,For this season
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:50 PM",No,but overall?
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:50 PM",Yes,Hasselbeck is really good still
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:50 PM",No,matt flynn is higher than both of them LOL
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:50 PM",Yes,It's just for this season
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:50 PM",Yes,That's bs
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:50 PM",No,eh i guess
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:51 PM",Yes,This list is rebadged
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:51 PM",Yes,*retarded
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:50 PM",No,i love how some guys who didn't even throw at all were ranked higher
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:51 PM",No,no way is cam newton at number 15...
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:51 PM",No,or behind jay cutler LOL
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:51 PM",Yes,If he actually knew anything about locker he would know he played through injuries and has not run or pass blocking support. Even the commentators were like this guy has. Lot of potential
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:52 PM",No,eh well everyone has potential just whether or not they'll actually get to it before they get injured or just never can actually play
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:52 PM",No,tophur so biased
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:52 PM",Yes,No....why do u think qbs like dalton were drafted
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:52 PM",No,dalton is decent
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:52 PM",No,he'll get better
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:52 PM",No,ill be biased and say that russell wilson's accuracy is probably higher than almost all the top ten qbs lol especially give the score he got on this lol
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:52 PM",No,maybe but dalton is so limited...and he has freakng AJ Green and he misses lol
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:53 PM",Yes,He was drafted because e was a solid qb not cuz of his upside
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:53 PM",No,dalton always hesitates thats his problem
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:53 PM",No,he's got the arm and accuracy tho
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:54 PM",Yes,How am I biased....for locker....he's good. 
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:54 PM",No,did you know matt cassell never started a college football game
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:54 PM",Yes,Why do u think they are keeping locker 
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:54 PM",No,gosh everyone has upside or they won't draft them...
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:55 PM",Yes,There is a huge difference between drafting a qb like newton russel Wilson and rg3 vs dalton...
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:54 PM",No,obviously but not all of them would pan out even if they had a ton of upside
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:55 PM",Yes,Arm strength intangibles leadership. Things u can't measure by just easing numbers
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:56 PM",Yes,Dalton was not drafted cuz of his upside. 
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:56 PM",No,from what i read he was suppose to be an extreme project qb
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:56 PM",Yes,He was drafted because he's a prototypical qb
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:56 PM",No,but i mean obviously theres a reason he was a late second round guy lol
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:56 PM",No,which obviously means he has upside...
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:56 PM",No,he was close to winning OROY last season
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:56 PM",No,only lost cause of cam newton
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:56 PM",No,i believe
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:58 PM",Yes,Dalton isn't bad that's not what in saying
+12069924635,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:58 PM",No,No soul = no upside
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:58 PM",No,and i would say his performance so far has showed he has upside and def did more than what was expected
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:58 PM",No,LOL addy
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:58 PM",No,i watched a couple bengals game
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:59 PM",Yes,Yea but that's not what upside is
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:58 PM",No,dalton is really scared of making long throws
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:58 PM",No,when he totally could to aj green
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:58 PM",No,he hesitates and loses it
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:58 PM",No,has to be more decisive and he'll be good
+12069924635,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:58 PM",No,Linsen he sees things we don't. 
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:58 PM",No,alright so you would agree rg3 and luck didn't have upside because they were number 1 and 2 right?
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:58 PM",Yes,upside is like building around a quarterback with a strong arm or mobility 
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:58 PM",Yes,who isnt a polished qb yet
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 12:58 PM",No,people knew for almost a fact they were gonna be good

+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 1:00 PM",No,in that case then russell wilson should be the most polished qb not luck and rg3....he had a 70+ completion percentage and the highest NCAA passer rating in history
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 1:00 PM",No,aj green is one of those receivers you just get the ball too

+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 1:00 PM",Yes,just because they have upside doesnt mean they are good
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 1:00 PM",No,but obviously people said he had upside still
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 1:00 PM",Yes,russel wilson played one year in the ncaa

+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 1:10 PM",Yes,oh yeah he was a big recruit. i like jeff lindquist form MI though he looks good
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 1:10 PM",No,is isaac dotson gonna be a starter?

+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 1:11 PM",No,nope he changed to WSU for qb
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 1:11 PM",Yes,wsu has a lot of good qb's i dont think they would recruit him as that. im pretty sure he was picked as aa ss or rb
+12069924635,"Feb 11, 2013, 1:11 PM",No,Dude all he did in highschool was run anyways
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 1:11 PM",No,nope look it up
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 1:11 PM",No,"well he was ""promised"" a chance to compete for QB lol"
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 1:11 PM",No,so we'll see what that means

+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 1:12 PM",Yes,theres no way lol...wsu's only good positions are strong safety and qb
+12066177563,"Feb 11, 2013, 1:13 PM",No,next year for intramural football

+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 1:13 PM",Yes,meaning he can be moved easily
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 1:14 PM",Yes,coach's can make promises doesnt mean they will always get them. but its possible. but honestly wsu's has so much depth in the qb position it would make no sense for him especially since as a qb hes a really low caliber recruit
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 1:14 PM",Yes,the only thing he has is his upside. size and a decent arm
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 1:15 PM",No,I know but he's going because he can be a qb rather than the other schools who want him for defense
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 1:15 PM",Yes,nevada wanted him at q
+14259431562,"Feb 11, 2013, 1:15 PM",No,Lol that was what Kaepernick was so you never know

+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 1:17 PM",Yes,yeah cuz wsu gave him a visit offer
+12064847887,"Feb 11, 2013, 1:17 PM",Yes,and he switched immediately after

+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:20 PM",No,"5 people, 1 always tells the truth, 4 toggles between truth and false"
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:20 PM",No,you get 2 questions 
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:20 PM",No,you can only direct each question at 1 person
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:22 PM",No,find out who is telling the truth
+14257365590,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:22 PM",No,So many things went wrong in that lab...

+14257365590,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:22 PM",No,Ask anyone if they always tell the truth
+14257365590,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:22 PM",No,Then ask the same person who the truth teller is
+12069924635,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:22 PM",No,Linsen what's the answer?
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:24 PM",No,i think its what david said
+14257365590,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:24 PM",No,"But that's an interestin riddle, I usually hear about the angel and paths to hell and heaven"
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:24 PM",No,that genius
+14257365590,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:25 PM",No,I just stopped walking to think about it for a while
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:25 PM",No,you ask them if they're the truth teller
+14259431562,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:25 PM",No,LOL that makes so much sense
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:25 PM",No,"if they say false, you know that they can't possible be the truth teller"
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:26 PM",No,"which means that they just told the truth, so the next thing they saw is false"
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:26 PM",No,"so you ask them, who ISN'T the truth teller"
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:26 PM",No,"if they say true, theres 2 possibilities, if they're the truth teller or if they aren't"
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:26 PM",No,"if they aren't, that means that they just lied which means they will tell the truth"
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:26 PM",No,so you just ask them who the truth teller is
+12069924635,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:28 PM",No,Holy moly that's genius 
+14259431562,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:28 PM",No,Wow logic
+12069924635,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:28 PM",No,I still prefer corporal punishment as an effective means of gleaning the truth 
+14257365590,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:29 PM",No,I feel so smart right now. I needed that after that Chem lab
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:29 PM",No,you were half right david
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:29 PM",No,you didn't get the whole thing
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:30 PM",No,but i'm glad i could help ;)
+14257365590,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:30 PM",No,Here's another one. There are two doors with an angel guarding each one. One always tells the truth and the other always lies. One door is to heaven and the other is to hell. You only get one question to one angel. Which door is heaven?
+14257365590,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:30 PM",No,Whatever linsen. The other part was obvious after you get the initial part ;)
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:31 PM",No,hmmm
+14259431562,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:32 PM",No,oooh time to feel smart
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:32 PM",No,you ask if they are the liar
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:32 PM",No,nvm
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:32 PM",No,that doesn't work
+14259431562,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:32 PM",No,no
+14257365590,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:34 PM",No,Googling the answer is not allowed
+12064847887,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:34 PM",Yes,Ask if the other guard about his door. 
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:34 PM",No,what does that even mean chris
+14257365590,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:34 PM",No,You're almost there Chris
+14259431562,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:34 PM",No,ask the guard if the other guard is a liar
+12064847887,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:35 PM",Yes,By his I mean the guard ur asking
+12064847887,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:35 PM",Yes,I've done this before haha 
+14257365590,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:35 PM",No,Bop
+14257365590,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:35 PM",No,Nope*
+12064847887,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:35 PM",Yes,What??
+12064847887,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:36 PM",Yes,If u ask guard to ask the other guard which way the first guard door leads to. 
+14259431562,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:37 PM",No,the guard could lie to the guard tho
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:37 PM",No,is that allowed??
+12064847887,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:37 PM",Yes,If he says hell then he's the good guard
+12064847887,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:37 PM",Yes,If he says heaven then he's the bad guard
+12064847887,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:37 PM",Yes,Lol I'm in class so I can't respond quickly 
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:37 PM",No,it doesn't matter if you know who the liar is 
+12069924635,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:37 PM",No,Wait what?
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:37 PM",No,or the good one is
+12064847887,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:37 PM",Yes,But that makes sense
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:37 PM",No,if you don't know what door they're guarding
+14257365590,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:37 PM",No,The guards can't talk to each other
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:37 PM",No,they couldl be guarding either door
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:38 PM",No,so you're question has to involve the doors
+12064847887,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:38 PM",Yes,Oh...lame. No that works if u could ask other guards
+14259431562,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:38 PM",No,ask which guard lies if they're guarding heaven
+12064847887,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:39 PM",Yes,Well u could ask what would the other guard say about your door
+12064847887,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:39 PM",Yes,It's the same thing
+14257365590,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:39 PM",No,Chris is correct
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:39 PM",No,hmm

+14257365590,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:40 PM",No,You would ask either guard what the other guard would say is the door to heaven. Then go to the opposite door
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:40 PM",No,"ohh, that makes sense"
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:40 PM",No,"man, this shit is tricky"
+12066177563,"Feb 12, 2013, 1:41 PM",No,"i had a really good one a long time ago, let me look it up"

Picture, if you will, the Isle of Row, a one-acre forsaken swatch of desert in the middle of the Sea of Troubles. Despite its diminutive size, Row has no less than four kinds of people, all outwardly indistinguishable from one another. There are the members of the First Family, who always tell the truth, and the Pretenders, who never do. There are the Eccentrics, who may or may not tell the truth, depending on whim. Finally there are the Wimps, who are incapable of speaking unless they have heard one of the other kinds of people speak, and then they obsequiously chime in. \LFOne day, as luck would have it, I found myself at the only crossroads on the island, facing four possible routes. Three Rowians stood by, milling about, and I had only two questions to ask in order to reach, as directly as possible, the fabled 100-foot Tower of Schmooze, the island's premier, albeit only, tourist attraction.

+14259431562,"Feb 19, 2013, 12:24 AM",No,of course id need some funding to secure a cloud server either on company grounds or leased from google or amazon...but the bonus coverage we get would compensate for the initial costs
+14257365590,"Feb 19, 2013, 12:25 AM",No,Hmm. Let's start with the Microsoft skydive since they have a lot of influence in corporate businesses. We could get a foothold in corporate service
+12066177563,"Feb 19, 2013, 12:27 AM",No,gayyy
+14259431562,"Feb 19, 2013, 12:27 AM",No,but but but I don't want to leave my secure and important data in the hands of a corporate tyrant
+12066177563,"Feb 19, 2013, 12:27 AM",No,i wonder how chris chan is going to react to this conversation
+14257365590,"Feb 19, 2013, 12:28 AM",No,They're all corporate tyrants. We just have to become bigger than them
+14257365590,"Feb 19, 2013, 12:29 AM",No,Until we're unbulliable
+14259431562,"Feb 19, 2013, 12:29 AM",No,Alright time to start up the ad campaign
+14259431562,"Feb 19, 2013, 12:29 AM",No,Should we use naked people or cute puppies 
+12066177563,"Feb 19, 2013, 12:29 AM",No,cute puppies
+14257365590,"Feb 19, 2013, 12:29 AM",No,Both
+12066177563,"Feb 19, 2013, 12:29 AM",No,you use the cute puppies
+14257365590,"Feb 19, 2013, 12:29 AM",No,It will blow their minds
+12066177563,"Feb 19, 2013, 12:29 AM",No,to cover up the junk
+14259431562,"Feb 19, 2013, 12:29 AM",No,Genius that would get everyone's attention
+14259431562,"Feb 19, 2013, 12:31 AM",No,alright time to secure Russell Wilson and find cute puppies
+14259431562,"Feb 19, 2013, 12:32 AM",No,"in the spirit of our tendency to produce Asian drinks, maybe we should adopt an Asian fusion theme to our marketing"
+14257365590,"Feb 19, 2013, 12:32 AM",No,Indeed
+14257365590,"Feb 19, 2013, 12:33 AM",No,In the morning after Addison has been shipped though.. It is time for me to sleep
+12069924635,"Feb 19, 2013, 12:33 AM",No,This is a strangely educating conversation 
+12066177563,"Feb 19, 2013, 12:34 AM",No,LOL
+12066177563,"Feb 19, 2013, 12:34 AM",No,"wilburtttt, for our app i was thinking we could do something school related"
+12066177563,"Feb 19, 2013, 12:34 AM",No,something productive for students
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:03 AM",Yes,3.5 stars!? SOMETIMES DEEMED AS UNCOOPERATIVE!? THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE! Why don't u  guys create a uw husky dumps app. Put locations for all the bathrooms at uw and allow users to rate the bathrooms. 
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:05 AM",Yes,Give summaries for each bathroom and print QR codes at bathrooms all around the campus for people to check in
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:05 AM",Yes,This way people know where the best place is to take a dump. 
+12069924635,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:05 AM",No,Automatic fb Check ins for the stalls 
+14257365590,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:05 AM",No,"That's stupid Chris. If a lot of people use the place, then it's not a good place for a dump"
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:05 AM",Yes,U can make the QR code fb check in for U as well. Yes Addison 
+14257365590,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:06 AM",No,"The idea of having a good place to take a dump is somewhere private where you can unload without fear of being overheard, where you can laugh at stuff while at the toilet"
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:06 AM",Yes,True so u can give them a variety of ratings
+14257365590,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:06 AM",No,COME ON CHRIS
+14257365590,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:07 AM",No,plus more people on that toilet... What if someone leaves herpes on the seat man
+14257365590,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:07 AM",No,All it would take is an accidental brush
+14257365590,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:07 AM",No,Of your penis against the seat
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:07 AM",Yes,So people who want clean bathrooms can go to some and some show any private bathrooms. Cuz for pissing no one cares about how many people are inside
+14257365590,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:07 AM",No,And BAM herpes
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:08 AM",Yes,But they want something clean. Another rating can give STD risks
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:08 AM",Yes,I think Wilbert and locs dorm bathroom would be relatively high for STD risk
+14257365590,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:08 AM",No,It should also show how many people have used the bathroom since it was last cleaned
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:09 AM",Yes,But someone would have to input when it was last cleaned which is highly unlikely considering how lazy people are but yes this is a a possibility as well
+14257365590,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:10 AM",No,We get the cleaning schedule from the university
+14257365590,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:10 AM",No,"It's. a simple matter, since they get cleaned regularly"
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:10 AM",Yes,Oh. WTF I wish they told me. In that case yes  that would be highly important
+12069924635,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:10 AM",No,Not unless people like Chris shit on the toilet 
+12069924635,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:10 AM",No,Seat 
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:11 AM",Yes,We could offer push notifications for certain bathrooms that people want to see when they are clean
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:11 AM",Yes,Remember it's when I piss on the rim. Not poop on it
+12069924635,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:11 AM",No,That's not what I heard 
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:12 AM",Yes,What else would I do?
+14257365590,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:12 AM",No,Also we could have a mode
+14257365590,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:12 AM",No,Called urgent mode
+14257365590,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:12 AM",No,Shows you the closest bathrooms available 
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:12 AM",Yes,Lol I think the funniest part about all this is this app is relatively easy to make too
+12069924635,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:12 AM",No,Also if you have to pee. It shows you where secluded bushes are 
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:13 AM",Yes,Only hard part would be setting up a server and paying for an ISP. 
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:13 AM",Yes,But that's not even that hard cuz the user input is so simple lol
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:14 AM",Yes,U could call it husky dumps
+14257365590,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:14 AM",No,Hmm. How hard would it e to connect it to fb? Doesn't fb charge the apps for their service?
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:16 AM",Yes,Depends if android or apple
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:17 AM",Yes,Well tbh lol i don't know. I've only done it on iphone apps. But I heard android might
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:17 AM",Yes,They both might be free though cuz all u have to do is download the ask
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:17 AM",Yes,*sdk
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:19 AM",Yes,Lol oh wait nvm yeah. I made an android app a while ago for some club. Facebook sdk is free as well. So yeah lol this app is doable. 
+14257365590,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:27 AM",No,Go for it
+14257365590,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:30 AM",No,You would require some knowledge of the extensive number of bathrooms around campus though
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:34 AM",Yes,lol wilbert and linsen should do it 
+12064847887,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:36 AM",Yes,actually addison do u always have to get up this early for school?
+12069924635,"Feb 19, 2013, 8:36 AM",No,Yeah

+12064847887,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:35 PM",Yes,build it way cheaper
+14257365590,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:37 PM",No,How much would building one with like an i5 core cost
+14257365590,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:37 PM",No,Or comparable to i5
+14257365590,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:37 PM",No,"Hard drive doesn't really matter as much, I doubt ram and hard drives are that expensive as long as I don't get solid state drives"
+14257365590,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:37 PM",No,I suppose the motherboard would be expensive?
+12064847887,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:39 PM",Yes,an i5 chip costs like $200. u need a LGA 1156 motherboard for the i5 which is like $70 for a good deal. gpu u prob want to get something in the $100 if u wanna play games. HDD's are cheap right now so u can prob get a tb for like $80 on sale
+12064847887,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:39 PM",Yes,u prob want a mid tower for that which costs another 70-80
+14257365590,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:39 PM",No,Lol what's a midterm
+14257365590,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:39 PM",No,Mid tower*
+12064847887,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:39 PM",Yes,its a size of the computer case u get
+12064847887,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:39 PM",Yes,its like the average size of a computer case basically. the ones at school 
+14257365590,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:41 PM",No,I see
+14257365590,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:41 PM",No,Around 500 then. Oh and I guess I need to buy fans and other random stuff as well?
+12064847887,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:43 PM",Yes,U need a CPU cooler. The fans in the case should be sufficient for the rest. 
+14257365590,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:44 PM",No,Well shit. I might as well get a ps4
+12064847887,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:44 PM",Yes,CPU cooler costs can be a wide range of costs. For an i5 u prob want something nice though
+12064847887,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:44 PM",Yes,Lol yeah the ps4 isn't a bad price. And the CPU chip is faster than anything a consumer can buy. Not the gpu though. 
+12069924635,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:44 PM",No,There we go David 
+14257365590,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:45 PM",No,Unfortunately ps4 would require a tv that I don't have
+12064847887,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:45 PM",Yes,U can use a monitor
+14257365590,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:47 PM",No,"Neither of which I possess. Oh well, we shall see"
+12064847887,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:47 PM",Yes,U need a monitor for ur pc anyways
+12069924635,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:54 PM",No,Yeah you dumb 
+14257365590,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:54 PM",No,But I feel obligated to buy a really nice monitor for a ps4
+14257365590,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:54 PM",No,While desktop... Not as much
+12069924635,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:55 PM",No,You need a pretty nice for a desktop anyways. But the ps4 won't run steam or anything anyways 
+14257365590,"Feb 20, 2013, 8:56 PM",No,"Yeah, I suppose a desktop would be more versatile"
+12066177563,"Feb 21, 2013, 1:42 AM",No,the hero in the new infamous game can control smoke

+12066177563,"Feb 21, 2013, 1:23 PM",No,I don't like touchscreens
+14257365590,"Feb 21, 2013, 1:24 PM",No,... You have an iPhone

+12064847887,"Feb 21, 2013, 1:32 PM",Yes,Touchscreens have coating on it that doesn't attract smudges that's why ur iphone  screen doesn't smudge or get dirty. 
+14259431562,"Feb 21, 2013, 1:32 PM",No,It does smudge and get dirty after awhile and loses sensitivity
+14259431562,"Feb 21, 2013, 1:32 PM",No,And they're running out of the current touchscreen conductor material right now so it'll be interesting to see what they'll use instead
+14257365590,"Feb 21, 2013, 1:32 PM",No,"Really? I think my phone is still pretty sensitive after two years, and I don't think a laptop touch screen will get as much of an intensive touch usage as a phone"

+12064847887,"Feb 21, 2013, 1:40 PM",Yes,Don't even know what it is. Still I don't think it's a great idea
+12064847887,"Feb 21, 2013, 1:40 PM",Yes,They should focus on the Apple TV
+14257365590,"Feb 21, 2013, 1:41 PM",No,"Eh. I would be all up for this Internet tv thing at home as well, but the cable tv fee is actually cheaper if we get tv and Internet together as opposed to just Internet"
+12064847887,"Feb 21, 2013, 1:43 PM",Yes,Well I think what they want to do is start using LTE and higher generation wireless networks to run television and Internet providers as a whole. This way u don't have to pay so much to upgrade all te cables underneath ground to fiber optics
+12066177563,"Feb 21, 2013, 1:43 PM",No,penis
+12064847887,"Feb 21, 2013, 1:43 PM",Yes,To get even close to the same speeds
